          garb of a slave went up the side of that mountain that is all
          covered with forest, the Mountain Pelion. He carried in his arms a
          little child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When it was
          full noon the slave came into a clearing of the forest so silent
          that it seemed empty of all life. He laid the child down on the
          soft moss, and then, trembling with the fear of what might come
          before him, he raised a horn to his lips and blew three blasts upon
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then he waited.
          The blue sky was above him, the great trees stood away from him,
          and the little child lay at his feet. He waited, and then he heard
          the thud-thud of great hooves. And then from between the trees he
          saw coming toward him the strangest of all beings, one who was half
          man and half horse; this was Chiron the centaur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Chiron came
          toward the trembling slave. Greater than any horse was Chiron,
          taller than any man. The hair of his head flowed back into his
          horse’s mane, his great beard flowed over his horse’s chest; in his
          man’s hand he held a great spear.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page4">[pg 4]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Not swiftly he
          came, but the slave could see that in those great limbs of his
          there was speed like to the wind’s. The slave fell upon his knees.
          And with eyes that were full of majesty and wisdom and limbs that
          were full of strength and speed, the king-centaur stood above him.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O my lord,”</span> the slave said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have come before thee sent by Æson, my
          master, who told me where to come and what blasts to blow upon the
          horn. And Æson, once King of Iolcus, bade me say to thee that if
          thou dost remember his ancient friendship with thee thou wilt,
          perchance, take this child and guard and foster him, and, as he
          grows, instruct him with thy wisdom.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For Æson’s sake I will rear and foster this
          child,”</span> said Chiron the king-centaur in a deep voice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The child lying
          on the moss had been looking up at the four-footed and two-handed
          centaur. Now the slave lifted him up and placed him in the
          centaur’s arms. He said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Æson bade me tell thee that the child’s name is Jason.
          He bade me give thee this ring with the great ruby in it that thou
          mayst give it to the child when he is grown. By this ring with its
          ruby and the images engraved on it Æson may know his son when they
          meet after many years and many changes. And another thing Æson bade
          me say to thee, O my lord Chiron: not presumptuous is he, but he
          knows that this child has the regard of the immortal Goddess Hera,
          the wife of Zeus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Chiron held
          Æson’s son in his arms, and the little child put hands into his
          great beard. Then the centaur said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
          Æson <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span> know that
          his son will be reared and fostered by me, and that, when they meet
          again, there will be ways by which they will be known to each
          other.”</span></p>

          Chiron the centaur, holding the child in his arms, went swiftly
          toward the forest arches; then the slave took up the horn and went
          down the side of the Mountain Pelion. He came to where a horse was
          hidden, and he mounted and rode, first to a city, and then to a
          village that was beyond the city.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All this was
          before the famous walls of Troy were built; before King Priam had
          come to the throne of his father and while he was still known, not
          as Priam, but as Podarces. And the beginning of all these
          happenings was in Iolcus, a city in Thessaly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Cretheus
          founded the city and had ruled over it in days before King Priam
          was born. He left two sons, Æson and Pelias. Æson succeeded his
          father. And because he was a mild and gentle man the men of war did
          not love Æson; they wanted a hard king who would lead them to
          conquests.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias, the
          brother of Æson, was ever with the men of war; he knew what mind
          they had toward Æson and he plotted with them to overthrow his
          brother. This they did, and they brought Pelias to reign as king in
          Iolcus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The people
          loved Æson and they feared Pelias. And because the people loved him
          and would be maddened by his slaying, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page6">[pg 6]</span> Pelias and the men of war left him living.
          With his wife, Alcimide, and his infant son, Æson went from the
          city, and in a village that was at a distance from Iolcus he found
          a hidden house and went to dwell in it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Æson would have
          lived content there were it not that he was fearful for Jason, his
          infant son. Jason, he knew, would grow into a strong and a bold
          youth, and Pelias, the king, would be made uneasy on his account.
          Pelias would slay the son, and perhaps would slay the father for
          the son’s sake when his memory would come to be less loved by the
          people. Æson thought of such things in his hidden house, and he
          pondered on ways to have his son reared away from Iolcus and the
          dread and the power of King Pelias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He had for a
          friend one who was the wisest of all creatures—Chiron the centaur;
          Chiron who was half man and half horse; Chiron who had lived and
          was yet to live measureless years. Chiron had fostered Heracles,
          and it might be that he would not refuse to foster Jason, Æson’s
          child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Away in the
          fastnesses of Mount Pelion Chiron dwelt; once Æson had been with
          him and had seen the centaur hunt with his great bow and his great
          spears. And Æson knew a way that one might come to him; Chiron
          himself had told him of the way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now there was a
          slave in his house who had been a huntsman and who knew all the
          ways of the Mountain Pelion. Æson talked with this slave one day,
          and after he had talked with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page7">[pg 7]</span> him he sat for a long time over the cradle of
          his sleeping infant. And then he spoke to Alcimide, his wife,
          telling her of a parting that made her weep. That evening the slave
          came in and Æson took the child from the arms of the mournful-eyed
          mother and put him in the slave’s arms. Also he gave him a horn and
          a ring with a great ruby in it and mystic images engraved on its
          gold. Then when the ways were dark the slave mounted a horse, and,
          with the child in his arms, rode through the city that King Pelias
          ruled over. In the morning he came to that mountain that is all
          covered with forest, the Mountain Pelion. And that evening he came
          back to the village and to Æson’s hidden house, and he told his
          master how he had prospered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Æson was
          content thereafter although he was lonely and although his wife was
          lonely in their childlessness. But the time came when they rejoiced
          that their child had been sent into an unreachable place. For
          messengers from King Pelias came inquiring about the boy. They told
          the king’s messengers that the child had strayed off from his
          nurse, and that whether he had been slain by a wild beast or had
          been drowned in the swift River Anaurus they did not know.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The years went
          by and Pelias felt secure upon the throne he had taken from his
          brother. Once he sent to the oracle of the gods to ask of it
          whether he should be fearful of anything. What the oracle answered
          was this: that King Pelias had but one thing to dread—the coming of
          a half-shod man.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg
          8]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The centaur
          nourished the child Jason on roots and fruits and honey; for
          shelter they had a great cave that Chiron had lived in for
          numberless years. When he had grown big enough to leave the cave
          Chiron would let Jason mount on his back; with the child holding on
          to his great mane he would trot gently through the ways of the
          forest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason began to
          know the creatures of the forest and their haunts. Sometimes Chiron
          would bring his great bow with him; then Jason, on his back, would
          hold the quiver and would hand him the arrows. The centaur would
          let the boy see him kill with a single arrow the bear, the boar, or
          the deer. And soon Jason, running beside him, hunted too.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> No heroes were
          ever better trained than those whose childhood and youth had been
          spent with Chiron the king-centaur. He made them more swift of foot
          than any other of the children of men. He made them stronger and
          more ready with the spear and bow. Jason was trained by Chiron as
          Heracles just before him had been trained, and as Achilles was to
          be trained afterward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Moreover,
          Chiron taught him the knowledge of the stars and the wisdom that
          had to do with the ways of the gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once, when they
          were hunting together, Jason saw a form at the end of an alley of
          trees—the form of a woman it was—of a woman who had on her head a
          shining crown. Never had Jason dreamt of seeing a form so wondrous.
          Not very near did he come, but he thought he knew that the woman
          smiled upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span> him.
          She was seen no more, and Jason knew that he had looked upon one of
          the immortal goddesses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All day Jason
          was filled with thought of her whom he had seen. At night, when the
          stars were out, and when they were seated outside the cave, Chiron
          and Jason talked together, and Chiron told the youth that she whom
          he had seen was none other than Hera, the wife of Zeus, who had for
          his father Æson and for himself an especial friendliness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Jason grew
          up upon the mountain and in the forest fastnesses. When he had
          reached his full height and had shown himself swift in the hunt and
          strong with the spear and bow, Chiron told him that the time had
          come when he should go back to the world of men and make his name
          famous by the doing of great deeds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And when Chiron
          told him about his father Æson—about how he had been thrust out of
          the kingship by Pelias, his uncle—a great longing came upon Jason
          to see his father and a fierce anger grew up in his heart against
          Pelias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the time
          came when he bade good-by to Chiron his great instructor; the time
          came when he went from the centaur’s cave for the last time, and
          went through the wooded ways and down the side of the Mountain
          Pelion. He came to the river, to the swift Anaurus, and he found it
          high in flood. The stones by which one might cross were almost all
          washed over; far apart did they seem in the flood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now as he stood
          there pondering on what he might do there <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page10">[pg 10]</span> came up to him an old woman who had on
          her back a load of brushwood. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wouldst thou
          cross?”</span> asked the old woman. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Wouldst thou cross and get thee to the city of Iolcus,
          Jason, where so many things await thee?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Greatly was the
          youth astonished to hear his name spoken by this old woman, and to
          hear her give the name of the city he was bound for. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Wouldst thou cross the Anaurus?”</span> she asked
          again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then mount upon my back, holding on
          to the wood I carry, and I will bear thee over the
          river.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason smiled.
          How foolish this old woman was to think that she could bear him
          across the flooded river! She came near him and she took him in her
          arms and lifted him up on her shoulders. Then, before he knew what
          she was about to do, she had stepped into the water.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> From stone to
          stepping-stone she went, Jason holding on to the wood that she had
          drawn to her shoulders. She left him down upon the bank. As she was
          lifting him down one of his feet touched the water; the swift
          current swept away a sandal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He stood on the
          bank knowing that she who had carried him across the flooded river
          had strength from the gods. He looked upon her, and behold! she was
          transformed. Instead of an old woman there stood before him one who
          had on a golden robe and a shining crown. Around her was a wondrous
          light—the light of the sun when it is most golden. Then Jason knew
          that she who had carried him across the broad Anaurus was the
          goddess <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span> whom he
          had seen in the ways of the forest—Hera, great Zeus’s wife.</p>

          King Pelias, walking through the streets of his city, saw coming
          toward him a youth who was half shod. He remembered the words of
          the oracle that bade him beware of a half-shod man, and straightway
          he gave orders to his guards to lay hands upon the youth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the guards
          wavered when they went toward him, for there was something about
          the youth that put them in awe of him. He came with the guards,
          however, and he stood before the king’s judgment seat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Fearfully did
          Pelias look upon him. But not fearfully did the youth look upon the
          king. With head lifted high he cried out, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page12">[pg 12]</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art
          Pelias, but I do not salute thee as king. Know that I am Jason, the
          son of Æson from whom thou hast taken the throne and scepter that
          were rightfully his.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Pelias
          looked to his guards. He would have given them a sign to destroy
          the youth’s life with their spears, but behind his guards he saw a
          threatening multitude—the dwellers of the city of Iolcus; they
          gathered around, and Pelias knew that he had become more and more
          hated by them. And from the multitude a cry went up, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Æson, Æson! May Æson come back to us! Jason, son of
          Æson! May nothing evil befall thee, brave youth!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Pelias
          knew that the youth might not be slain. He bent his head while he
          plotted against him in his heart. Then he raised his eyes, and
          looking upon Jason he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O goodly
          youth, it well may be that thou art the son of Æson, my brother. I
          am well pleased to see thee here. I have had hopes that I might be
          friends with Æson, and thy coming here may be the means to the
          renewal of our friendship. We two brothers may come together again.
          I will send for thy father now, and he will be brought to meet thee
          in my royal palace. Go with my guards and with this rejoicing
          people, and in a little while thou and I and thy father Æson will
          sit at a feast of friends.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Pelias said,
          and Jason went with the guards and the crowd of people, and he came
          to the palace of the king and he was brought within. The maids led
          him to the bath and gave him new robes to wear. Dressed in these
          Jason looked a prince indeed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But all that
          while King Pelias remained on his judgment seat <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span> with his crowned head bent
          down. When he raised his head his dark brows were gathered together
          and his thin lips were very close. He looked to the swords and
          spears of his guards, and he made a sign to the men to stand close
          to him. Then he left the judgment seat and he went to the
          palace.</p>

          Jason into a hall where Æson, his father, waited. Very strange did
          this old and grave-looking man appear to him. But when Æson spoke,
          Jason remembered the tone of his father’s voice and he clasped him
          to him. And his father knew him even without the sight of the ruby
          ring which Jason had upon his finger.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the young
          man began to tell of the centaur and of his life upon the Mountain
          Pelion. As they were speaking together Pelias came to where they
          stood, Pelias in the purple robe of a king and with the crown upon
          his head. Æson tightly clasped Jason as if he had become fearful
          for his son. Pelias smilingly took the hand of the young man and
          the hand of his brother, and he bade them both welcome to his
          palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, walking
          between them, the king brought the two into the feasting hall. The
          youth who had known only the forest and the mountainside had to
          wonder at the beauty and the magnificence <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page14">[pg 14]</span> of all he saw around him. On the walls
          were bright pictures; the tables were of polished wood, and they
          had vessels of gold and dishes of silver set upon them; along the
          walls were vases of lovely shapes and colors, and everywhere there
          were baskets heaped with roses white and red.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king’s
          guests were already in the hall, young men and elders, and maidens
          went amongst them carrying roses which they strung into wreaths for
          the guests to put upon their heads. A soft-handed maiden gave Jason
          a wreath of roses and he put it on his head as he sat down at the
          king’s table. When he looked at all the rich and lovely things in
          that hall, and when he saw the guests looking at him with friendly
          eyes, Jason felt that he was indeed far away from the dim spaces of
          the mountain forest and from the darkness of the centaur’s
          cave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Rich food and
          wine such as he had never dreamt of tasting were brought to the
          tables. He ate and drank, and his eyes followed the fair maidens
          who went through the hall. He thought how glorious it was to be a
          king. He heard Pelias speak to Æson, his father, telling him that
          he was old and that he was weary of ruling; that he longed to make
          friends, and that he would let no enmity now be between him and his
          brother. And he heard the king say that he, Jason, was young and
          courageous, and that he would call upon him to help to rule the
          land, and that, in a while, Jason would bear full sway over the
          kingdom that Cretheus had founded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Pelias spoke
          to Æson as they both sat together at the king’s <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span> high table. But Jason,
          looking on them both, saw that the eyes that his father turned on
          him were full of warnings and mistrust.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> After they had
          eaten King Pelias made a sign, and a cup-bearer bringing a richly
          wrought cup came and stood before the king. The king stood up,
          holding the cup in his hands, and all in the hall waited silently.
          Then Pelias put the cup into Jason’s hands and he cried out in a
          voice that was heard all through the hall, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Drink from this cup, O nephew Jason! Drink from this
          cup, O man who will soon come to rule over the kingdom that
          Cretheus founded!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All in the hall
          stood up and shouted with delight at that speech. But the king was
          not delighted with their delight, Jason saw. He took the cup and he
          drank the rich wine; pride grew in him; he looked down the hall and
          he saw faces all friendly to him; he felt as a king might feel,
          secure and triumphant. And then he heard King Pelias speaking once
          more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is my nephew Jason, reared and fostered in the
          centaur’s cave. He will tell you of his life in the forest and the
          mountains—his life that was like to the life of the half
          gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason
          spoke to them, telling them of his life on the Mountain Pelion.
          When he had spoken, Pelias said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I was bidden by the oracle to beware of the man whom I
          should see coming toward me half shod. But, as you all see, I have
          brought the half-shod man to my palace and my feasting hall, so
          little do I dread the anger of the gods.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I dread it little because I am blameless. This

          of my brother, is strong and courageous, and I rejoice in his
          strength and courage, for I would have him take my place and reign
          over you. Ah, that I were as young as he is now! Ah, that I had
          been reared and fostered as he was reared and fostered by the wise
          centaur and under the eyes of the immortals! Then would I do that
          which in my youth I often dreamed of doing! Then would I perform a
          deed that would make my name and the name of my city famous
          throughout all Greece! Then would I bring from far Colchis the
          famous Fleece of Gold that King Æetes keeps guard over!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He finished
          speaking, and all in the hall shouted out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Golden Fleece, the Golden Fleece from
          Colchis!”</span> Jason stood up, and his father’s hand gripped him.
          But he did not heed the hold of his father’s hand, for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Golden Fleece, the Golden Fleece!”</span> rang in
          his ears, and before his eyes were the faces of those who were all
          eager for the sight of the wonder that King Æetes kept guard
          over.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said
          Jason, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast spoken well, O King
          Pelias! Know, and know all here assembled, that I have heard of the
          Golden Fleece and of the dangers that await on any one who should
          strive to win it from King Æetes’s care. But know, too, that I
          would strive to win the Fleece and bring it to Iolcus, winning fame
          both for myself and for the city.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When he had
          spoken he saw his father’s stricken eyes; they were fixed upon him.
          But he looked from them to the shining eyes of the young men who
          were even then pressing around <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page17">[pg 17]</span> where he stood. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jason, Jason!”</span> they shouted. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Golden Fleece for Iolcus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“King Pelias knows that the winning of the Golden
          Fleece is a feat most difficult,”</span> said Jason. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But if he will have built for me a ship that can make
          the voyage to far Colchis, and if he will send throughout all
          Greece the word of my adventuring so that all the heroes who would
          win fame might come with me, and if ye, young heroes of Iolcus,
          will come with me, I will peril my life to win the wonder that King
          Æetes keeps guard over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He spoke and
          those in the hall shouted again and made clamor around him. But
          still his father sat gazing at him with stricken eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Pelias
          stood up in the hall and holding up his scepter he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O my nephew Jason, and O friends assembled

          that ever sailed from a harbor in Greece. And I promise that I will
          send throughout all Greece a word telling of Jason’s voyage so that
          all heroes desirous of winning fame may come to help him and to
          help all of you who may go with him to win from the keeping of King
          Æetes the famous Fleece of Gold.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So King Pelias
          said, but Jason, looking to the king from his father’s stricken

          the voyage so that he might fare far from Iolcus, and perhaps lose
          his life in striving to gain the wonder that King Æetes kept
          guarded. By the glitter in Pelias’s eyes he knew the truth.
          Nevertheless Jason would not take back one <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page18">[pg 18]</span> word that he had spoken; his heart was
          strong within him, and he thought that with the help of the
          bright-eyed youths around and with the help of those who would come
          to him at the word of the voyage, he would bring the Golden Fleece
          to Iolcus and make famous for all time his own name.</p>

          came the youths <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Polydeuces</span></span>. They came
          riding on white horses, two noble-looking brothers. From Sparta
          they came, and their mother was Leda, who, after the twin brothers,
          had another child born to her—Helen, for whose sake the sons of
          many of Jason’s friends were to wage war against the great city of
          Troy. These were the first heroes who came to Iolcus after the word
          had gone forth through Greece of Jason’s adventuring in quest of
          the Golden Fleece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then there
          came one who had both welcome and reverence from Jason; this one
          came without spear or bow, bearing in his hands a lyre only. He was
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Orpheus</span></span>, and he knew all
          the ways of the gods and all the stories of the gods; when he sang
          to his lyre the trees would listen and the beasts would follow him.
          It was Chiron who had counseled Orpheus to go with Jason; Chiron
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span> the centaur had
          met him as he was wandering through the forests on the Mountain
          Pelion and had sent him down into Iolcus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then there came
          two men well skilled in the handling of ships—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Tiphys</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Nauplius</span></span>. Tiphys knew all
          about the sun and winds and stars, and all about the signs by which
          a ship might be steered, and Nauplius had the love of Poseidon, the
          god of the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Afterward there
          came, one after the other, two who were famous for their hunting.
          No two could be more different than these two were. The first was
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Arcas</span></span>. He was dressed in
          the skin of a bear; he had red hair and savage-looking eyes, and
          for arms he carried a mighty bow with bronze-tipped arrows. The
          folk were watching an eagle as he came into the city—an eagle that
          was winging its way far, far up in the sky. Arcas drew his bow, and
          with one arrow he brought the eagle down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The other
          hunter was a girl, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Atalanta</span></span>. Tall and
          bright-haired was Atalanta, swift and good with the bow. She had
          dedicated herself to Artemis, the guardian of the wild things, and
          she had vowed that she would remain unwedded. All the heroes
          welcomed Atalanta as a comrade, and the maiden did all the things
          that the young men did.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There came a
          hero who was less youthful than Castor or Polydeuces; he was a man
          good in council named <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Nestor</span></span>. Afterward Nestor
          went to the war against Troy, and then he was the oldest of the
          heroes in the camp of Agamemnon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Two brothers
          came who were to be special friends of Jason’s—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Telamon</span></span>. Both were still
          youthful and neither had yet achieved any notable deed. Afterward
          they were to be famous, but their sons were to be even more famous,
          for the son of Telamon was strong Aias, and the son of Peleus was
          great Achilles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Another who
          came was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Admetus</span></span>; afterward he
          became a famous king. The God Apollo once made himself a shepherd
          and he kept the flocks of King Admetus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And there came
          two brothers, twins, who were a wonder to all who beheld them.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Zetes</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Calais</span></span> they were named;
          their mother was Oreithyia, the daughter of Erechtheus, King of
          Athens, and their father was Boreas, the North Wind. These two
          brothers had on their ankles wings that gleamed with golden scales;
          their black hair was thick upon their shoulders, and it was always
          being shaken by the wind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> With Zetes and
          Calais there came a youth armed with a great sword whose name was
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Theseus</span></span>. Theseus’s father
          was an unknown king; he had bidden the mother show their son where
          his sword was hidden. Under a great stone the king had hidden it
          before Theseus was born. Before he had grown out of his boyhood
          Theseus had been able to raise the stone and draw forth his
          father’s sword. As yet he had done no great deed, but he was
          resolved to win fame and to find his unknown father.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Great timbers
          were cut and brought down to Pagasæ, the harbor of Iolcus. On the
          night of the day he had helped to bring them down Jason had a
          dream. He dreamt that She whom he had seen in the forest ways and
          afterward by the River Anaurus appeared to him. And in his dream
          the goddess bade him rise early in the morning and welcome a man
          whom he would meet at the city’s gate—a tall and gray-haired man
          who would have on his shoulders tools for the building of a
          ship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He went to the
          city’s gate and he met such a man. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          told Jason that a dream had sent him to the city of Iolcus. Jason
          welcomed him and lodged him in the king’s palace, and that day the
          word went through the city that the building of the great ship
          would soon be begun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But not with
          the timbers brought from Mount Pelion did Argus begin. Walking
          through the palace with Jason he noted a great beam in the roof.
          That beam, he said, had been shown him in his dream; it was from an
          oak tree in Dodona, the grove of Zeus. A sacred power was in the
          beam, and from it the prow of the ship should be fashioned. Jason
          had them take the beam from the roof of the palace; it was brought
          to where the timbers were, and that day the building of the great
          ship was begun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then all along
          the waterside came the noise of hammering; in the street where the
          metalworkers were came the noise of beating <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span> upon metals as the smiths
          fashioned out of bronze armor for the heroes and swords and spears.
          Every day, under the eyes of Argus the master, the ship that had in
          it the beam from Zeus’s grove was built higher and wider. And those
          who were building the ship often felt going through it tremors as
          of a living creature.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the ship
          was built and made ready for the voyage a name was given to it—the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Argo</span></span> it was called. And
          naming themselves from the ship the heroes called themselves the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Argonauts</span></span>. All was ready
          for the voyage, and now Jason went with his friends to view the
          ship before she was brought into the water.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Argus the
          master was on the ship, seeing to it that the last things were
          being done before <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> was launched. Very grave and
          wise looked Argus—Argus the builder of the ship. And wonderful to
          the heroes the ship looked now that Argus, for their viewing, had
          set up the mast with the sails and had even put the oars in their
          places. Wonderful to the heroes <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          looked with her long oars and her high sails, with her timbers
          painted red and gold and blue, and with a marvelous figure carved
          upon her prow. All over the ship Jason’s eyes went. He saw a figure
          standing by the mast; for a moment he looked on it, and then the
          figure became shadowy. But Jason knew that he had looked upon the
          goddess whom he had seen in the ways of the forest and had seen
          afterward by the rough Anaurus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then mast and
          sails were taken down and the oars were left in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span> the ship, and the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> was launched into the water.
          The heroes went back to the palace of King Pelias to feast with the
          king’s guests before they took their places on the ship, setting
          out on the voyage to far Colchis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When they came
          into the palace they saw that another hero had arrived. His shield
          was hung in the hall; the heroes all gathered around, amazed at the
          size and the beauty of it. The shield shone all over with gold. In
          its center was the figure of Fear—of Fear that stared backward with
          eyes burning as with fire. The mouth was open and the teeth were
          shown. And other figures were wrought around the figure of
          Fear—Strife and Pursuit and Flight; Tumult and Panic and Slaughter.
          The figure of Fate was there dragging a dead man by the feet; on
          her shoulders Fate had a garment that was red with the blood of
          men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Around these
          figures were heads of snakes, heads with black jaws and glittering
          eyes, twelve heads such as might affright any man. And on other
          parts of the shield were shown the horses of Ares, the grim god of
          war. The figure of Ares himself was shown also. He held a spear in
          his hand, and he was urging the warriors on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Around the
          inner rim of the shield the sea was shown, wrought in white metal.
          Dolphins swam in the sea, fishing for little fishes that were shown
          there in bronze. Around the rim chariots were racing along with
          wheels running close together; there were men fighting and women
          watching from high towers. The awful figure of the Darkness of
          Death was shown there, too, with mournful <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page24">[pg 24]</span> eyes and the dust of battles upon her
          shoulders. The outer rim of the shield showed the Stream of Ocean,
          the stream that encircles the world; swans were soaring above and
          swimming on its surface.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All in wonder
          the heroes gazed on the great shield, telling each other that only
          one man in all the world could carry it—Heracles the son of Zeus.
          Could it be that Heracles had come amongst them? They went into the
          feasting hall and they saw one there who was tall as a pine tree,
          with unshorn tresses of hair upon his head. Heracles indeed it was!
          He turned to them a smiling face with smiling eyes. Heracles! They
          all gathered around the strongest hero in the world, and he took
          the hand of each in his mighty hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason spoke,
          and some looked to him and some looked to Heracles. But Heracles
          stood up, and, stretching out his hand, said:</p>

          and all the courage that he possessed. And he prayed the gods that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They drew lots
          for the benches they would sit at; they took the places that for
          the length of the voyage they would have on the ship. They made

          not silent; she lamented to the women of Iolcus who were gathered
          around her. <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not go down to the

          people shout as he went amongst them, they glorying in my son’s
          splendid appearance. Ah, that I might live to see his return and to
          hear the shout that will go up when the people look on Jason again!
          But I know that my life will not be spared so long; I will not look

          of Iolcus asked her to tell them of the Golden Fleece, and Alcimide
          told them of it and of the sorrows that were upon the race of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Cretheus, the
          father of Æson and Pelias, was of the race of Æolus, and of the
          race of Æolus, too, was Athamas, the king who ruled in Thebes at
          the same time that Cretheus ruled in Iolcus. And the first children
          of Athamas were Phrixus and Helle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          Athamas, your father, did you lives to be a curse to the line of
          Æolus!</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          Phrixus and Helle, the youth and maiden. But Athamas married again
          while the mother of these children was still living, and Ino, the
          new queen, drove Nephele and her children out of the king’s
          palace.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          servant, and her children were servants to the servants of the
          palace. They were clad in rags and had little to eat, and they were
          beaten often by the servants who wished to win the favor of the new
          queen.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          do, Phrixus and Helle looked the children of a queen. The boy was
          tall, and in his eyes there often came the flash of power, and the
          girl looked as if she would grow into a lovely maiden. And when
          Athamas, their father, would meet them by chance he would sigh,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span> and Queen Ino
          would know by that sigh that he had still some love for them in his
          heart. Afterward she would have to use all the power she possessed
          to win the king back from thinking upon his children.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          that the people reverenced the children of Nephele and cared
          nothing for her children. And because she knew this she feared that
          when Athamas died Phrixus and Helle, the children of Nephele, would
          be brought to rule in Thebes. Then she and her children would be
          made to change places with them.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          make Phrixus and Helle lose their lives. She thought long upon

          the women to roast over their fires the grains that had been left
          for seed. This the women did. Then spring came on, and the men
          sowed in the fields the grain that had been roasted over the fires.
          No shoots grew up as the spring went by. In summer there was no
          waving greenness in the fields. Autumn came, and there was no grain
          for the reaping. Then the men, not knowing what had happened, went
          to King Athamas and told him that there would be famine in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          taken gold from Queen Ino, told them that there would be worse and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          around the king, to save themselves from famine after famine,
          clamored to have the children sacrificed. Athamas, to save his
          people, consented to the sacrifice.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          her. They found Phrixus, half naked, digging in a field, and they
          took him, too, and bound him. That night they left brother and
          sister in the same prison. Helle wept over Phrixus, and Phrixus
          wept to think that he was not able to do anything to save his
          sister.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          mocked at her, telling her that her children would be sacrificed on
          the morrow. Nephele nearly went wild in her grief. And then,
          suddenly, there came into her mind the thought of a creature that
          might be a helper to her and to her children.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          fleece of gold. The god of the sea, Poseidon, had sent this
          wonderful ram to Athamas and Nephele as a marriage gift. And the
          ram had since been kept in a special fold.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To that fold Nephele went. She spent the night beside
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span> ram praying
          for its help. The morning came and the children were taken from
          their prison and dressed in white, and wreaths were put upon their
          heads to mark them as things for sacrifice. They were led in a
          procession to the temple of Artemis. Behind that procession King
          Athamas walked, his head bowed in shame.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But Queen Ino’s head was not bowed; rather she carried
          it high, for her thought was all upon her triumph. Soon Phrixus and
          Helle would be dead, and then, whatever happened, her own children
          would reign after Athamas in Thebes.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          last look at the sun, went on. And even then Nephele, holding the
          horns of the golden ram, was making her last prayer. The sun rose
          and as it did the ram spread out its great wings and flew through
          the air. It flew to the temple of Artemis. Down beside the altar
          came the golden ram, and it stood with its horns threatening those
          who came. All stopped in surprise. Still the ram stood with
          threatening head and great golden wings spread out. Then Phrixus
          ran from those who were holding him and laid his hands upon the
          ram. He called to Helle and she, too, came to the golden creature.
          Phrixus mounted on the ram and he pulled Helle up beside him. Then
          the golden ram flew upward. Up, up, it went, and with the children
          upon its back it became like a star in the day-lit sky.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          golden ram, shrieked and fled away from that place. Athamas ran
          after her. As she ran and as he followed hatred for her grew up
          within him. Ino ran on and on until she came to the cliffs that
          rose over the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span>
          sea. Fearing Athamas who came behind her she plunged down. But as
          she fell she was changed by Poseidon, the god of the sea. She
          became a seagull. Athamas, who followed her, was changed also; he
          became the sea eagle that, with beak and talons ever ready to
          strike, flies above the sea.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          on. Over the sea it flew while the wind whistled around the
          children. On and on they went, and the children saw only the blue
          sea beneath them. Then poor Helle, looking downward, grew dizzy.
          She fell off the golden ram before her brother could take hold of
          her. Down she fell, and still the ram flew on and on. She was
          drowned in that sea. The people afterward named it in memory of
          her, calling it <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          it flew and toward a river. Upon that river a white city was built.
          Down the ram flew, and alighting on the ground, stood before the
          gate of that city. It was the city of Aea, in the land of
          Colchis.</span></p>

          with the crowd that gathered around the strange golden creature
          that had a youth upon its back. The ram folded its wings and then
          the youth stood beside it. He spoke to the people, and then the
          king—Æetes was his name—spoke to him, asking him from what place he
          had come, and what was the strange creature upon whose back he had
          flown.</span></p>

          and he gave him a place in the palace, and for the golden ram he
          had a special fold made.</span></p>

          of the king, and men say that afterward he went back to Thebes, his

            in swaddling clothes and gave the stone to Cronos. And Cronos
            swallowed the stone, thinking to swallow his latest-born
            child.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That child
            was Zeus. Earth took Zeus and hid him in a deep cave and those
            who minded and nursed the child beat upon drums so that his cries
            might not be heard. His nurse was Adrastia; when he was able to
            play she gave him a ball to play with. All of gold was the ball,
            with a dark-blue spiral around it. When the boy Zeus would play
            with this ball it would make a track across the sky, flaming like
            a star.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Hyperion the
            Titan god wed Theia the Titan goddess, and their children were
            Helios, the bright Sun, and Selene, the clear Moon. And Cœus wed
            Phœbe, and their children were Leto, who is kind to gods and men,
            and Asteria of happy name, and Hecate, whom Zeus honored above
            all. Now the gods who were the children of Cronos and Rhea went
            up unto the Mountain Olympus, and there they built their shining
            palaces. But the Titan gods who were born of Heaven and Earth
            went up to the Mountain Othrys, and there they had their
            thrones.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Between the
            Olympians and the Titan gods of Othrys a war began. Neither side
            might prevail against the other. But now Zeus, grown up to be a
            youth, thought of how he might help the Olympians to overthrow
            the Titan gods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He went down
            into the deep parts of the Earth where the giants Cottus,
            Briareus, and Gyes had been hidden by their father. Cronos had
            bound them, weighing them down with chains. But now Zeus loosed
            them and the hundred-armed giants in their gratitude gave him the
            lightning and showed him how to use the thunderbolt.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Zeus would
            have the giants fight against the Titan gods. But although they
            had mighty strength Cottus, Briareus, and Gyes had no fire of
            courage in their hearts. Zeus thought of a way to give them this
            courage; he brought the food and drink of the gods to them,
            ambrosia and nectar, and when they had eaten and drunk their
            spirits grew within the giants, and they were ready to make war
            upon the Titan gods.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg
            36]</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Sons of Earth and Heaven,”</span> said Zeus to the
            hundred-armed giants, <span class="tei tei-q">“a long time now
            have the Dwellers on Olympus been striving with the Titan gods.
            Do you lend your unconquerable might to the gods and help them to
            overthrow the Titans.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Cottus, the
            eldest of the giants, answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
            One, through your devising we are come back again from the murky
            gloom of the mid Earth and we have escaped from the hard bonds
            that Cronus laid upon us. Our minds are fixed to aid you in the
            war against the Titan gods.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So the
            hundred-armed giants said, and thereupon Zeus went and he
            gathered around him all who were born of Cronos and Rhea. Cronos
            himself hid from Zeus. Then the giants, with their fifty heads
            growing from their shoulders and their hundred hands, went forth
            against the Titan gods. The boundless sea rang terribly and the
            earth crashed loudly; wide Heaven was shaken and groaned, and
            high Olympus reeled from its foundation. Holding huge rocks in
            their hands the giants attacked the Titan gods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Zeus
            entered the war. He hurled the lightning; the bolts flew thick
            and fast from his strong hand, with thunder and lightning and
            flame. The earth crashed around in burning, the forests crackled
            with fire, the ocean seethed. And hot flames wrapped the
            earth-born Titans all around. Three hundred rocks, one upon
            another, did Cottus, Briareus, and Gyes hurl upon the Titans. And
            when their ranks were broken the giants seized upon them and held
            them for Zeus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But some of
            the Titan gods, seeing that the strife for them <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span> was vain, went over to
            the side of Zeus. These Zeus became friendly with. But the other
            Titans he bound in chains and he hurled them down to
            Tartarus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As far as
            Earth is from Heaven so is Tartarus from Earth. A brazen anvil
            falling down from Heaven to Earth nine days and nine nights would
            reach the earth upon the tenth day. And again, a brazen anvil
            falling from Earth nine nights and nine days would reach Tartarus
            upon the tenth night. Around Tartarus runs a fence of bronze and
            Night spreads in a triple line all about it, as a necklace
            circles the neck. There Zeus imprisoned the Titan gods who had
            fought against him; they are hidden in the misty gloom, in a dank
            place, at the ends of the Earth. And they may not go out, for
            Poseidon fixed gates of bronze upon their prison, and a wall runs
            all round it. There Cottus, Briareus, and Gyes stay, guarding
            them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And there,
            too, is the home of Night. Night and Day meet each other at that
            place, as they pass a threshold of bronze. They draw near and
            they greet one another, but the house never holds them both
            together, for while one is about to go down into the house, the
            other is leaving through the door. One holds Light in her hand
            and the other holds in her arms Sleep.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There the
            children of dark Night have their dwellings—Sleep, and Death, his
            brother. The sun never shines upon these two. Sleep may roam over
            the wide earth, and come upon the sea, and he is kindly to men.
            But Death is not kindly, and whoever he seizes upon, him he holds
            fast.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There, too,
            stands the hall of the lord of the Underworld, Aidoneus, the
            brother of Zeus. Zeus gave him the Underworld to be his dominion
            when he shared amongst the Olympians the world that Cronos had
            ruled over. A fearful hound guards the hall of Aidoneus: Cerberus
            he is called; he has three heads. On those who go within that
            hall Cerberus fawns, but on those who would come out of it he
            springs and would devour them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Not all the
            Titans did Zeus send down to Tartarus. Those of them who had
            wisdom joined him, and by their wisdom Zeus was able to overcome
            Cronos. Then Cronos went to live with the friendly Titan gods,
            while Zeus reigned over Olympus, becoming the ruler of gods and
            men.</p>

          that they were to return to; the unnamed country where the

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span> from his

          the Mountain of the Bears, where they climbed, to make sacrifice

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          hung slack. But the heroes swore to each other that they would make
          their ship go as swiftly as if the storm-footed steeds of Poseidon
          were racing to overtake her. Mightily they labored at the oars, and
          no one would be first to leave his rower’s bench.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then, just
          as the breeze of the evening came up, and just as the rest of the
          heroes were leaning back, spent with their labor, the oar that
          Heracles still pulled at broke, and half of it was carried away by
          the waves. Heracles sat there in ill humor, for he did not know
          what to do with his unlaboring hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All through the
          night they went on with a good breeze filling their sails, and next
          day they came to the mouth of the River Cius. There they landed so
          that Heracles might get himself an oar. No sooner did they set
          their feet upon the shore than the hero went off into the forest,
          to pull up a tree that he might shape into an oar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Where they had
          landed was near to the country of the Bebrycians, a rude people
          whose king was named Amycus. Now while Heracles was away from them
          this king came with his followers—huge, rude men, all armed with
          clubs, down to where the Argonauts were lighting their fires on the
          beach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He did not
          greet them courteously, asking them what manner <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span> of men they were and
          whither they were bound, nor did he offer them hospitality.
          Instead, he shouted at them insolently:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Listen to something that you rovers had better know. I
          am Amycus, and any stranger that comes to this land has to get into
          a boxing bout with me. That’s the law that I have laid down. Unless
          you have one amongst you who can stand up to me you won’t be let go
          back to your ship. If you don’t heed my law, look out, for
          something’s going to happen to you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So he shouted,
          that insolent king, and his followers raised their clubs and
          growled approval of what their master said. But the Argonauts were
          not dismayed at the words of Amycus. One of them stepped toward the
          Bebrycians. He was Polydeuces, good at boxing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Offer us no violence, king,”</span> said Polydeuces.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We are ready to obey the law that you have
          laid down. Willingly do I take up your challenge, and I will box a
          bout with you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          cheered when they saw Polydeuces, the good boxer, step forward, and
          when they heard what he had to say. Amycus turned and shouted to
          his followers, and one of them brought up two pairs of boxing
          gauntlets—of rough cowhide they were. The Argonauts feared that
          Polydeuces’ hands might have been made numb with pulling at the
          oar, and some of them went to him, and took his hands and rubbed
          them to make them supple; others took from off his shoulders his
          beautifully colored mantle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Amycus
          straightway put on his gauntlets and threw off his <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span> mantle; he stood there
          amongst his followers with his great arms crossed, glowering at the
          Argonauts as a wild beast might glower. And when the two faced each
          other Amycus seemed like one of the Earth-born Men, dark and hugely
          shaped, while Helen’s brother stood there light and beautiful.
          Polydeuces was like that star whose beams are lovely at
          evening-tide.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Like the wave
          that breaks over a ship and gives the sailors no respite Amycus
          came on at Polydeuces. He pushed in upon him, thinking to bear him
          down and overwhelm him. But as the skillful steersman keeps the
          ship from being overwhelmed by the monstrous wave, so Polydeuces,
          all skill and lightness, baffled the rushes of Amycus. At last
          Amycus, standing on the tips of his toes and rising high above him,
          tried to bring down his great fist upon the head of Polydeuces. The
          hero swung aside and took the blow on his shoulder. Then he struck
          his blow. It was a strong one, and under it the king of the
          Bebrycians staggered and fell down. <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          see,”</span> said Polydeuces, <span class="tei tei-q">“that we keep

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          shouted, but the rude Bebrycians raised their clubs to rush upon
          them. Then would the heroes have been hard pressed, and forced,
          perhaps, to get back to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          appeared amongst them, coming up from the forest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He carried a
          pine tree in his hands with all its branches still upon it, and
          seeing this mighty-statured man appear with the great tree in his

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span> king with them.
          Then the Argonauts gathered around Polydeuces, saluted him as their
          champion, and put a crown of victory upon his head. Heracles,
          meanwhile, lopped off the branches of the pine tree and began to
          fashion it into an oar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The fires were
          lighted upon the shore, and the thoughts of all were turned to
          supper. Then young Hylas, who used to sit by Heracles and keep
          bright the hero’s arms and armor, took a bronze vessel and went to
          fetch water.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Never was there
          a boy so beautiful as young Hylas. He had golden curls that tumbled
          over his brow. He had deep blue eyes and a face that smiled at
          every glance that was given him, at every word that was said to
          him. Now as he walked through the flowering grasses, with his knees
          bare, and with the bright vessel swinging in his hand, he looked
          most lovely. Heracles had brought the boy with him from the country
          of the Dryopians; he would have him sit beside him on the bench of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>, and the ill humors that
          often came upon him would go at the words and the smile of
          Hylas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now the spring
          that Hylas was going toward was called Pegæ, and it was haunted by
          the nymphs. They were dancing around it when they heard Hylas
          singing. They stole softly off to watch him. Hidden behind trees
          the nymphs saw the boy come near, and they felt such love for him
          that they thought they could never let him go from their sight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They stole back
          to their spring, and they sank down below its clear surface. Then
          came Hylas singing a song that he had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page43">[pg 43]</span> heard from his mother. He bent down to the
          spring, and the brimming water flowed into the sounding bronze of
          the pitcher. Then hands came out of the water. One of the nymphs
          caught Hylas by the elbow; another put her arms around his neck,
          another took the hand that held the vessel of bronze. The pitcher
          sank down to the depths of the spring. The hands of the nymphs
          clasped Hylas tighter, tighter; the water bubbled around him as
          they drew him down. Down, down they drew him, and into the cold and
          glimmering cave where they live.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There Hylas
          stayed. But although the nymphs kissed him and sang to him, and
          showed him lovely things, Hylas was not content to be there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Where the
          Argonauts were the fires burned, the moon arose, and still Hylas
          did not return. Then they began to fear lest a wild beast had
          destroyed the boy. One went to Heracles and told him that young
          Hylas had not come back, and that they were fearful for him.
          Heracles flung down the pine tree that he was fashioning into an
          oar, and he dashed along the way that Hylas had gone as if a gadfly
          were stinging him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hylas, Hylas,”</span>
          he cried. But Hylas, in the cold and glimmering cave that the
          nymphs had drawn him into, did not hear the call of his friend
          Heracles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All the
          Argonauts went searching, calling as they went through the island,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hylas, Hylas, Hylas!”</span> But only
          their own calls came back to them. The morning star came up, and
          Tiphys, the steersman, called to them from the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          And when they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span>
          came to the ship Tiphys told them that they would have to go aboard
          and make ready to sail from that place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They called to
          Heracles, and Heracles at last came down to the ship. They spoke to
          him, saying that they would have to sail away. Heracles would not
          go on board. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not leave this
          island,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“until I find
          young Hylas or learn what has happened to him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason
          arose to give the command to depart. But before the words were said
          Telamon stood up and faced him. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jason,”</span> he said angrily, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you do not bid Heracles come on board, and you would
          have the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> leave without him. You would
          leave Heracles here so that he may not be with us on the quest
          where his glory might overshadow your glory, Jason.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason said no
          word, but he sat back on his bench with head bowed. And then, even
          as Telamon said these angry words, a strange figure rose up out of
          the waves of the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was the
          figure of a man, wrinkled and old, with seaweed in his beard and
          his hair. There was a majesty about him, and the Argonauts all knew
          that this was one of the immortals—he was Nereus, the ancient one
          of the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To Heracles, and to you, the rest of the Argonauts, I
          have a thing to say,”</span> said the ancient one, Nereus.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Know, first, that Hylas has been taken by
          the nymphs who love him and who think to win his love, and that he
          will stay forever with them in their cold and glimmering cave. For
          Hylas seek no more. And to you, Heracles, I will say this: Go
          aboard the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> again; the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span> ship will take you to where
          a great labor awaits you, and which, in accomplishing, you will
          work out the will of Zeus. You will know what this labor is when a
          spirit seizes on you.”</span> So the ancient one of the sea said,
          and he sank back beneath the waves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles went
          aboard the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> once more, and he took his
          place on the bench, the new oar in his hand. Sad he was to think
          that young Hylas who used to sit at his knee would never be there
          again. The breeze filled the sail, the Argonauts pulled at the
          oars, and in sadness they watched the island where young Hylas had
          been lost to them recede from their view.</p>

          short time. But the passage into the Sea of Pontus is most
          perilous, and few mortals dare even to make approach to
          it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Said Jason, the
          chieftain of the host: <span class="tei tei-q">“The dangers of the
          passage, Tiphys, we have spoken of, and it may be that we shall
          have to carry <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> overland to the Sea of
          Pontus. But you, Tiphys, have spoken of a wise king who is
          hereabouts, and who might help us to make the dangerous passage.
          Speak again to us, and tell us what the dangers of the passage are,
          and who the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span>
          king is who may be able to help us to make these dangers
          less.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said
          Tiphys, the steersman of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-q">“No
          ship sailed by mortals has as yet gone through the passage that
          brings this sea into the Sea of Pontus. In the way are the rocks
          that mariners call The Clashers. These rocks are not fixed as rocks
          should be, but they rush one against the other, dashing up the sea,
          and crushing whatever may be between. Yea, if <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          were of iron, and if she were between these rocks when they met,
          she would be crushed to bits. I have sailed as far as that passage,
          but seeing The Clashers strike together I turned back my ship, and
          journeyed as far as the Sea of Pontus overland.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But I have been told of one who knows how a ship may
          be taken through the passage that The Clashers make so perilous. He
          who knows is a king hereabouts, Phineus, who has made himself as
          wise as the gods. To no one has Phineus told how the passage may be
          made, but knowing what high favor has been shown to us, the
          Argonauts, it may be that he will tell us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Tiphys said,
          and Jason commanded him to steer the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          toward the city where ruled Phineus, the wise king.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> To Salmydessus,
          then, where Phineus ruled, Tiphys steered the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          They left Heracles with Tiphys aboard to guard the ship, and, with
          the rest of the heroes, Jason went through the streets of the city.
          They met many men, but when they asked <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page47">[pg 47]</span> any of them how they might come to the
          palace of King Phineus the men turned fearfully away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They found
          their way to the king’s palace. Jason spoke to the servants and
          bade them tell the king of their coming. The servants, too, seemed
          fearful, and as Jason and his comrades were wondering what there
          was about him that made men fearful at his name, Phineus, the king,
          came amongst them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Were it not
          that he had a purple border to his robe no one would have known him
          for the king, so miserable did this man seem. He crept along,
          touching the walls, for the eyes in his head were blind and
          withered. His body was shrunken, and when he stood before them
          leaning on his staff he was like to a lifeless thing. He turned his
          blinded eyes upon them, looking from one to the other as if he were
          searching for a face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then his
          sightless eyes rested upon Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas,
          the North Wind. A change came into his face as it turned upon them.
          One would think that he saw the wonder that these two were endowed
          with—the wings that grew upon their ankles. It was a while before
          he turned his face from them; then he spoke to Jason and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have come to have counsel with one who has the
          wisdom of the gods. Others before you have come for such counsel,
          but seeing the misery that is visible upon me they went without
          asking for counsel. I would strive to hold you here for a while.
          Stay, and have sight of the misery the gods visit upon those who
          would be as wise as they. And when you have seen the thing
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span> that is wont to
          befall me, it may be that help will come from you for
          me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Phineus,
          the blind king, left them, and after a while the heroes were
          brought into a great hall, and they were invited to rest themselves
          there while a banquet was being prepared for them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The hall was
          richly adorned, but it looked to the heroes as if it had known
          strange happenings; rich hangings were strewn upon the ground, an
          ivory chair was overturned, and the dais where the king sat had
          stains upon it. The servants who went through the hall making ready
          the banquet were white-faced and fearful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The feast was
          laid on a great table, and the heroes were invited to sit down to
          it. The king did not come into the hall before they sat down, but a
          table with food was set before the dais. When the heroes had
          feasted, the king came into the hall. He sat at the table, blind,
          white-faced, and shrunken, and the Argonauts all turned their faces
          to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Said Phineus,
          the blind king: <span class="tei tei-q">“You see, O heroes, how
          much my wisdom avails me. You see me blind and shrunken, who tried
          to make myself in wisdom equal to the gods. And yet you have not
          seen all. Watch now and see what feasts Phineus, the wise king, has
          to delight him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He made a sign,
          and the white-faced and trembling servants brought food and set it
          upon the table that was before him. The king bent forward as if to
          eat, and they saw that his face was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page49">[pg 49]</span> covered with the damp of fear. He took food
          from the dish and raised it to his mouth. As he did, the doors of
          the hall were flung open as if by a storm. Strange shapes flew into
          the hall and set themselves beside the king. And when the Argonauts
          looked upon them they saw that these were terrible and unsightly
          shapes.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were
          things that had the wings and claws of birds and the heads of
          women. Black hair and gray feathers were mixed upon them; they had
          red eyes, and streaks of blood were upon their breasts and wings.
          And as the king raised the food to his mouth they flew at him and
          buffeted his head with their wings, and snatched the food from his
          hands. Then they devoured or scattered what was upon the table, and
          all the time they screamed and laughed and mocked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, now ye see,”</span> Phineus panted, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what it is to have wisdom equal to the wisdom of the
          gods. Now ye all see my misery. Never do I strive to put food to my
          lips but these foul things, the Harpies, the Snatchers, swoop down
          and scatter or devour what I would eat. Crumbs they leave me that
          my life may not altogether go from me, but these crumbs they make
          foul to my taste and my smell.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And one of the
          Harpies perched herself on the back of the king’s throne and looked
          upon the heroes with red eyes. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hah,”</span> she screamed, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you bring armed men into your feasting hall, thinking
          to scare us away. Never, Phineus, can you scare us from you! Always
          you will have us, the Snatchers, beside you <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span> when you would still your
          ache of hunger. What can these men do against us who are winged and
          who can travel through the ways of the air?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So said the
          unsightly Harpy, and the heroes drew together, made fearful by
          these awful shapes. All drew back except Zetes and Calais, the sons
          of the North Wind. They laid their hands upon their swords. The
          wings on their shoulders spread out and the wings at their heels
          trembled. Phineus, the king, leaned forward and panted:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“By the wisdom I have I know that there are
          two amongst you who can save me. O make haste to help me, ye who
          can help me, and I will give the counsel that you Argonauts have
          come to me for, and besides I will load down your ship with
          treasure and costly stuffs. Oh, make haste, ye who can help
          me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Hearing the
          king speak like this, the Harpies gathered together and gnashed
          with their teeth, and chattered to one another. Then, seeing Zetes
          and Calais with their hands upon their swords, they rose up on
          their wings and flew through the wide doors of the hall. The king
          cried out to Zetes and Calais. But the sons of the North Wind had
          already risen with their wings, and they were after the Harpies,
          their bright swords in their hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On flew the
          Harpies, screeching and gnashing their teeth in anger and dismay,
          for now they felt that they might be driven from Salmydessus, where
          they had had such royal feasts. They rose high in the air and flew
          out toward the sea. But high as the Harpies rose, the sons of the
          North Wind rose higher. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page51">[pg 51]</span> Harpies cried pitiful cries as they flew
          on, but Zetes and Calais felt no pity for them, for they knew that
          these dread Snatchers, with the stains of blood upon their breasts
          and wings, had shown pity neither to Phineus nor to any other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On they flew
          until they came to the island that is called the Floating Island.
          There the Harpies sank down with wearied wings. Zetes and Calais
          were upon them now, and they would have cut them to pieces with
          their bright swords, if the messenger of Zeus, Iris, with the
          golden wings, had not come between.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Forbear to slay the Harpies, sons of Boreas,”</span>
          cried Iris warningly, <span class="tei tei-q">“forbear to slay the
          Harpies that are the hounds of Zeus. Let them cower here and hide
          themselves, and I, who come from Zeus, will swear the oath that the
          gods most dread, that they will never again come to Salmydessus to
          trouble Phineus, the king.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The heroes
          yielded to the words of Iris. She took the oath that the gods most
          dread—the oath by the Water of Styx—that never again would the
          Harpies show themselves to Phineus. Then Zetes and Calais turned
          back toward the city of Salmydessus. The island that they drove the
          Harpies to had been called the Floating Island, but thereafter it
          was called the Island of Turning. It was evening when they turned

          into King Phineus’s hall, their bright swords in their hands. The
          Argonauts crowded around them and King Phineus raised his head and
          stretched out his thin hands to them. And Zetes and Calais told
          their comrades and told the king how they had driven the Harpies
          down to the Floating Island, and how Iris, the messenger of Zeus,
          had sworn the great oath that was by the Water of Styx that never
          again would the Snatchers show themselves in the palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then a great
          golden cup brimming with wine was brought to the king. He stood
          holding it in his trembling hands, fearful even then that the
          Harpies would tear the cup out of his hands. He drank—long and
          deeply he drank—and the dread shapes of the Snatchers did not
          appear. Down amongst the heroes he came and he took into his the
          hands of Zetes and Calais, the sons of the North Wind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O heroes greater than any kings,”</span> he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ye have delivered me from the terrible
          curse that the gods had sent upon me. I thank ye, and I thank ye
          all, heroes of the quest. And the thanks of Phineus will much avail
          you all.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Clasping the
          hands of Zetes and Calais he led the heroes through <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span> hall after hall of his
          palace and down into his treasure chamber. There he bestowed upon
          the banishers of the Harpies crowns and arm rings of gold and
          richly colored garments and brazen chests in which to store the
          treasure that he gave. And to Jason he gave an ivory-hilted and
          gold-encased sword, and on each of the voyagers he bestowed a rich
          gift, not forgetting the heroes who had remained on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>,
          Heracles and Tiphys.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They went back
          to the great hall, and a feast was spread for the king and for the
          Argonauts. They ate from rich dishes and they drank from flowing
          wine cups. Phineus ate and drank as the heroes did, and no dread
          shapes came before him to snatch from him nor to buffet him. But as
          Jason looked upon the man who had striven to equal the gods in
          wisdom, and noted his blinded eyes and shrunken face, he resolved
          never to harbor in his heart such presumption as Phineus had
          harbored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the feast
          was finished the king spoke to Jason, telling him how the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> might be guided through the
          Symplegades, the dread passage into the Sea of Pontus. He told them
          to bring their ship near to the Clashing Rocks. And one who had the
          keenest sight amongst them was to stand at the prow of the ship
          holding a pigeon in his hands. As the rocks came together he was to
          loose the pigeon. If it found a space to fly through they would
          know that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> could make the passage, and
          they were to steer straight toward where the pigeon had flown. But
          if it fluttered down to the sea, or flew back to them, or became
          lost in the clouds of spray, they were to know that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          might not make <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span>
          that passage. Then the heroes would have to take their ship
          overland to where they might reach the Sea of Pontus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That day they
          bade farewell to Phineus, and with the treasures he had bestowed
          upon them they went down to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          To Heracles and Tiphys they gave the presents that the king had
          sent them. In the morning they drew the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          out of the harbor of Salmydessus, and set sail again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But not until
          long afterward did they come to the Symplegades, the passage that
          was to be their great trial. For they landed first in a country
          that was full of woods, where they were welcomed by a king who had
          heard of the voyagers and of their quest. There they stayed and
          hunted for many days in the woods. And there a great loss befell
          the Argonauts, for Tiphys, as he went through the woods, was bitten
          by a snake and died. He who had braved so many seas and so many
          storms lost his life away from the ship. The Argonauts made a tomb
          for him on the shore of that land—a great pile of stones, in which
          they fixed upright his steering oar. Then they set sail again, and
          Nauplius was made the steersman of the ship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The course was
          not so clear to Nauplius as it had been to Tiphys. The steersman
          did not find his bearings, and for many days and nights the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> was driven on a backward
          course. They came to an island that they knew to be that Island of
          Lemnos that they had passed on the first days of the voyage, and
          they resolved to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg
          55]</span> rest there for a while, and then to press on for the
          passage into the Sea of Pontus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They brought
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> near the shore. They blew
          trumpets and set the loudest voiced of the heroes to call out to
          those upon the island. But no answer came to them, and all day the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> lay close to the island.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There were
          hidden people watching them, people with bows in their hands and
          arrows laid along the bowstrings. And the people who thus
          threatened the unknowing Argonauts were women and young girls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There were no
          men upon the Island of Lemnos. Years before a curse had fallen upon
          the people of that island, putting strife between the men and the
          women. And the women had mastered the men and had driven them away
          from Lemnos. Since then some of the women had grown old, and the
          girls who were children when their fathers and brothers had been
          banished were now of an age with Atalanta, the maiden who went with
          the Argonauts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They chased the
          wild beasts of the island, and they tilled the fields, and they
          kept in good repair the houses that were built before the banishing
          of the men. The older women served those who were younger, and they
          had a queen, a girl whose name was Hypsipyle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The women who
          watched with bows in their hands would have shot their arrows at
          the Argonauts if Hypsipyle’s nurse, Polyxo, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span> had not stayed them. She
          forbade them to shoot at the strangers until she had brought to
          them the queen’s commands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She hastened to
          the palace and she found the young queen weaving at a loom. She
          told her about the ship and the strangers on board the ship, and
          she asked the queen what word she should bring to the guardian
          maidens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Before you give a command, Hypsipyle,”</span> said
          Polyxo, the nurse, <span class="tei tei-q">“consider these words of
          mine. We, the elder women, are becoming ancient now; in a few years
          we will not be able to serve you, the younger women, and in a few
          years more we will have gone into the grave and our places will
          know us no more. And you, the younger women, will be becoming
          strengthless, and no more will be you able to hunt in the woods nor
          to till the fields, and a hard old age will be before
          you.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The ship that is beside our shore may have come at a
          good time. Those on board are goodly heroes. Let them land in
          Lemnos, and stay if they will. Let them wed with the younger women
          so that there may be husbands and wives, helpers and helpmeets,
          again in Lemnos.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Hypsipyle, the
          queen, let the shuttle fall from her hands and stayed for a while
          looking full into Polyxo’s face. Had her nurse heard her say
          something like this out of her dreams, she wondered? She bade the
          nurse tell the guardian maidens to let the heroes land in safety,
          and that she herself would put the crown of King Thoas, her father,
          upon her head, and go down to the shore to welcome
          them.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now the
          Argonauts saw people along the shore and they caught sight of
          women’s dresses. The loudest voiced amongst them shouted again, and
          they heard an answer given in a woman’s voice. They drew up the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> upon the shore, and they set
          foot upon the land of Lemnos.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason stepped
          forth at the head of his comrades, and he was met by Hypsipyle, her
          father’s crown upon her head, at the head of her maidens. They
          greeted each other, and Hypsipyle bade the heroes come with them to
          their town that was called Myrine and to the palace that was
          there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Wonderingly the
          Argonauts went, looking on women’s forms and faces and seeing no
          men. They came to the palace and went within. Hypsipyle mounted the
          stone throne that was King Thoas’s and the four maidens who were
          her guards stood each side of her. She spoke to the heroes in
          greeting and bade them stay in peace for as long as they would. She
          told them of the curse that had fallen upon the people of Lemnos,
          and of how the menfolk had been banished. Jason, then, told the
          queen what voyage he and his companions were upon and what quest
          they were making. Then in friendship the Argonauts and the women of
          Lemnos stayed together—all the Argonauts except Heracles, and he,
          grieving still for Hylas, stayed aboard the <em class=

          had honey-tasting things to eat, and when they went through the
          island each man might have with him one of the maidens of Lemnos.
          It was a change that was welcome to the wearied voyagers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They helped the

          the Argonauts, and they stayed day after day, thinking each day a
          fresh adventure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Sometimes they
          would leave the fields and the chase, and this hero or that hero,

          covered with golden and silver water lilies, or would gather the
          blue flowers from creepers that grew around dark trees, or would
          hide themselves so that they might listen to the quick-moving birds

          see the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          think of Heracles who was aboard, and they would call to him. But
          the ship and the voyage they had been on now seemed far away to
          them, and the Quest of the Golden Fleece <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page59">[pg 59]</span> seemed to them a story they had heard
          and that they had thought of, but that they could never think on
          again with all that fervor.</p>

          looked on Hypsipyle he saw one who seemed to him to be only
          childlike in size. Greatly was he amazed at the words that poured
          forth from her as she stood at the stone throne of King Thoas—he
          was amazed as one is amazed at the rush of rich notes that comes
          from the throat of a little bird; all that she said was made
          lightninglike by her eyes—her eyes that were not clear and quiet
          like the eyes of the maidens he had seen in Iolcus, but that were
          dark and burning. Her mouth was heavy and this heavy mouth gave a
          shadow to her face that but for it was all bright and lovely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Hypsipyle spoke
          two languages—one, the language of the mothers of the women of
          Lemnos, which was rough and harsh, a speech to be flung out to
          slaves, and the other the language of Greece, which their fathers
          had spoken, and which Hypsipyle spoke in a way that made it sound
          like strange music. She spoke and walked and did all things in a
          queenlike way, and Jason could see that, for all her youth and
          childlike size, Hypsipyle was one who was a ruler.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> From the moment
          she took his hand it seemed that she could not bear to be away from

          Jason. Hours and hours he would spend sitting beside her or
          watching her while she arrayed herself in white or in brightly
          colored garments. Not to the chase and not into the fields did
          Jason go, nor did he ever go with the others into the Lemnian land;
          all day he sat in the palace with her, watching her, or listening
          to her singing, or to the long, fierce speeches that she used to
          make to her nurse or to the four maidens who attended her.</p>

          sang beautifully, but none of them had any stories to tell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And when the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once when
            Demeter was going through the world, giving men grain to be sown
            in their fields, she heard a cry that came to her from across
            high mountains and that mounted up to her from the sea. Demeter’s
            heart shook when she heard that cry, for she knew that it came to
            her from her daughter, from her only child, young Persephone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She stayed
            not to bless the fields in which the grain was being sown, but
            she hurried, hurried away, to Sicily and to the fields of Enna,
            where she had left Persephone. All Enna she searched, and all
            Sicily, but she found no trace of Persephone, nor of the maidens
            whom Persephone had been playing with. From all whom she met she
            begged for tidings, but although some had seen maidens gathering
            flowers and playing together, no one could tell Demeter why her
            child had cried out nor where she had since gone to.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There were
            some who could have told her. One was Cyane, a water nymph. But
            Cyane, before Demeter came to her, had been changed into a spring
            of water. And now, not being able to speak and tell Demeter where
            her child had gone to and who had carried her away, she showed in
            the water the girdle of Persephone that she had caught in her
            hands. And Demeter, finding the girdle of her child in the
            spring, knew that she had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page62">[pg 62]</span> been carried off by violence. She lighted
            a torch at Ætna’s burning mountain, and for nine days and nine
            nights she went searching for her through the darkened places of
            the earth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, upon a
            high and a dark hill, the Goddess Demeter came face to face with
            Hecate, the Moon. Hecate, too, had heard the cry of Persephone;
            she had sorrow for Demeter’s sorrow: she spoke to her as the two
            stood upon that dark, high hill, and told her that she should go
            to Helios for tidings—to bright Helios, the watcher for the gods,
            and beg Helios to tell her who it was who had carried off by
            violence her child Persephone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Demeter came
            to Helios. He was standing before his shining steeds, before the
            impatient steeds that draw the sun through the course of the
            heavens. Demeter stood in the way of those impatient steeds; she
            begged of Helios who sees all things upon the earth to tell her
            who it was had carried off by violence Persephone, her child.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Helios,
            who may make no concealment, said: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Queenly Demeter, know that the king of the
            Underworld, dark Aidoneus, has carried off Persephone to make her
            his queen in the realm that I never shine upon.”</span> He spoke,
            and as he did, his horses shook their manes and breathed out
            fire, impatient to be gone. Helios sprang into his chariot and
            went flashing away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Demeter,
            knowing that one of the gods had carried off Persephone against
            her will, and knowing that what was done had been done by the
            will of Zeus, would go no more into the assemblies <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span> of the gods. She quenched
            the torch that she had held in her hands for nine days and nine
            nights; she put off her robe of goddess, and she went wandering
            over the earth, uncomforted for the loss of her child. And no
            longer did she appear as a gracious goddess to men; no longer did
            she give them grain; no longer did she bless their fields. None
            of the things that it had pleased her once to do would Demeter do
            any longer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Persephone
            had been playing with the nymphs who are the daughters of
            Ocean—Phæno, Ianthe, Melita, Ianeira, Acaste—in the lovely fields
            of Enna. They went to gather flowers—irises and crocuses, lilies,
            narcissus, hyacinths and rose-blooms—that grow in those fields.
            As they went, gathering flowers in their baskets, they had sight
            of Pergus, the pool that the white swans come to sing in.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Beside a deep
            chasm that had been made in the earth a wonder flower was
            growing—in color it was like the crocus, but it sent forth a
            perfume that was like the perfume of a hundred flowers. And
            Persephone thought as she went toward it that having gathered
            that flower she would have something much more wonderful than her
            companions had.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She did not
            know that Aidoneus, the lord of the Underworld, had caused that
            flower to grow there so that she might be drawn by it to the
            chasm that he had made.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As Persephone
            stooped to pluck the wonder flower, Aidoneus, <span class=

            dashed up through the chasm, and grasping the maiden by the
            waist, set her beside him. Only Cyane, the nymph, tried to save
            Persephone, and it was then that she caught the girdle in her
            hands.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The maiden
            cried out, first because her flowers had been spilled, and then
            because she was being reft away. She cried out to her mother, and
            her cry went over high mountains and sounded up from the sea. The
            daughters of Ocean, affrighted, fled and sank down into the
            depths of the sea.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In his great
            chariot of iron that was drawn by black steeds Aidoneus rushed
            down through the chasm he had made. Into the Underworld he went,
            and he dashed across the River Styx, and he brought his chariot
            up beside his throne. And on his dark throne he seated
            Persephone, the fainting daughter of Demeter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> No more did
            the Goddess Demeter give grain to men; no more did she bless

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She wandered
            through the world, her thought all upon her child, Persephone,

            thinking upon the child that she might not come to and who might
            not come to her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She saw four
            maidens come near; their grace and their youth <span class=

            child. They stepped lightly along, carrying bronze pitchers in

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The maidens
            thought when they looked upon her that the goddess was some
            ancient woman who had a sorrow in her heart. Seeing that she was
            so noble and so sorrowful looking, the maidens, as they drew the
            clear water into their pitchers, spoke kindly to her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Why do you stay away from the town, old

            "tei tei-q">“Why do you not come to the houses? We think that you
            look as if you were shelterless and alone, and we should like to
            tell you that there are many houses in the town where you would
            be welcomed.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Demeter’s
            heart went out to the maidens, because they looked so young and
            fair and simple and spoke out of such kind hearts. She said to
            them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Where can I go, dear children? My
            people are far away, and there are none in all the world who
            would care to be near me.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Said one of
            the maidens: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are princes in the
            land who would welcome you in their houses if you would consent
            to nurse one of their young children. But why do I speak of other
            princes beside Celeus, our father? In his house you would indeed
            have a welcome. But lately a baby has been born to our mother,
            Metaneira, and she would greatly rejoice to have one as wise as
            you mind little Demophoön.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All the time
            that she watched them and listened to their <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span> voices Demeter felt that
            the grace and youth of the maidens made them like Persephone. She
            thought that it would ease her heart to be in the house where
            these maidens were, and she was not loath to have them go and ask
            of their mother to have her come to nurse the infant child.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Swiftly they
            ran back to their home, their hair streaming behind them like
            crocus flowers; kind and lovely girls whose names are well
            remembered—Callidice and Cleisidice, Demo and Callithoë. They
            went to their mother and they told her of the stranger-woman
            whose name was Doso. She would make a wise and a kind nurse for
            little Demophoön, they said. Their mother, Metaneira, rose up
            from the couch she was sitting on to welcome the stranger. But
            when she saw her at the doorway, awe came over her, so majestic
            she seemed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Metaneira
            would have her seat herself on the couch but the goddess took the
            lowliest stool, saying in greeting: <span class="tei tei-q">“May
            the gods give you all good, lady.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Sorrow has set you wandering from your good
            home,”</span> said Metaneira to the goddess, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“but now that you have come to this place you shall
            have all that this house can bestow if you will rear up to youth
            the infant Demophoön, child of many hopes and
            prayers.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The child was
            put into the arms of Demeter; she clasped him to her breast, and
            little Demophoön looked up into her face and smiled. Then
            Demeter’s heart went out to the child and to all who were in the
            household.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em">  <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span> He grew in strength and
            beauty in her charge. And little Demophoön was not nourished as
            other children are nourished, but even as the gods in their
            childhood were nourished. Demeter fed him on ambrosia, breathing
            on him with her divine breath the while. And at night she laid
            him on the hearth, amongst the embers, with the fire all around
            him. This she did that she might make him immortal, and like to
            the gods.</p>

            Metaneira looked out from the chamber where she lay, and she saw
            the nurse take little Demophoön and lay him in a place on the
            hearth with the burning brands all around him. Then Metaneira
            started up, and she sprang to the hearth, and she snatched the

            arms?”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said
            Demeter: <span class="tei tei-q">“Foolish indeed are you mortals,
            and not able to foresee what is to come to you of good or of
            evil! Foolish indeed are you, Metaneira, for in your heedlessness
            you have cut off this child from an immortality like to the
            immortality of the gods themselves. For he had lain in my bosom
            and had become dear to me and I would have bestowed upon him the
            greatest gift that the Divine Ones can bestow, for I would have
            made him deathless and unaging. All this, now, has gone by. Honor
            he shall have indeed, but Demophoõn will know age and
            death.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The seeming
            old age that was upon her had fallen from <span class=

            stature were hers, and from her robe there came a heavenly
            fragrance. There came such light from her body that the chamber
            shone. Metaneira remained trembling and speechless, unmindful
            even to take up the child that had been laid upon the ground.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
            that his sisters heard Demophoön wail; one ran from her chamber
            and took the child in her arms; another kindled again the fire
            upon the hearth, and the others made ready to bathe and care for
            the infant. All night they cared for him, holding him in their
            arms and at their breasts, but the child would not be comforted,
            because the nurses who handled him now were less skillful than
            was the goddess-nurse.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And as for
            Demeter, she left the house of Celeus and went upon her way,
            lonely in her heart, and unappeased. And in the world that she
            wandered through, the plow went in vain through the ground; the
            furrow was sown without any avail, and the race of men saw
            themselves near perishing for lack of bread.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But again
            Demeter came near the Well of the Maiden. She thought of the
            daughters of Celeus as they came toward the well that day, the
            bronze pitchers in their hands, and with kind looks for the
            stranger—she thought of them as she sat by the well again. And
            then she thought of little Demophoön, the child she had held at
            her breast. No stir of living was in the land near their home,
            and only weeds grew in their fields. As she sat there and looked
            around her there came into Demeter’s heart a pity for the people
            in whose house she had dwelt.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em">  <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span> She rose up and she went
            to the house of Celeus. She found him beside his house measuring
            out a little grain. The goddess went to him and she told him that
            because of the love she bore his household she would bless his
            fields so that the seed he had sown in them would come to growth.
            Celeus rejoiced, and he called all the people together, and they
            raised a temple to Demeter. She went through the fields and
            blessed them, and the seed that they had sown began to grow. And
            the goddess for a while dwelt amongst that people, in her temple
            at Eleusis.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But still she
            kept away from the assemblies of the gods. Zeus sent a messenger
            to her, Iris with the golden wings, bidding her to Olympus.
            Demeter would not join the Olympians. Then, one after the other,
            the gods and goddesses of Olympus came to her; none were able to
            make her cease from grieving for Persephone, or to go again into
            the company of the immortal gods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And so it
            came about that Zeus was compelled to send a messenger down to
            the Underworld to bring Persephone back to the mother who grieved
            so much for the loss of her. Hermes was the messenger whom Zeus
            sent. Through the darkened places of the earth Hermes went, and
            he came to that dark throne where the lord Aidoneus sat, with
            Persephone beside him. Then Hermes spoke to the lord of the
            Underworld, saying <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg
            70]</span> that Zeus commanded that Persephone should come forth
            from the Underworld that her mother might look upon her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then
            Persephone, hearing the words of Zeus that might not be gainsaid,
            uttered the only cry that had left her lips since she had sent
            out that cry that had reached her mother’s heart. And Aidoneus,
            hearing the command of Zeus that might not be denied, bowed his
            dark, majestic head.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She might go
            to the Upperworld and rest herself in the arms of her mother, he
            said. And then he cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah,
            Persephone, strive to feel kindliness in your heart toward me who
            carried you off by violence and against your will. I can give to
            you one of the great kingdoms that the Olympians rule over. And
            I, who am brother to Zeus, am no unfitting husband for you,
            Demeter’s child.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Aidoneus,
            the dark lord of the Underworld said, and he made ready the iron
            chariot with its deathless horses that Persephone might go up
            from his kingdom.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Beside the
            single tree in his domain Aidoneus stayed the chariot. A single
            fruit grew on that tree, a bright pomegranate fruit. Persephone
            stood up in the chariot and plucked the fruit from the tree. Then
            did Aidoneus prevail upon her to divide the fruit, and, having
            divided it, Persephone ate seven of the pomegranate seeds.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was Hermes
            who took the whip and the reins of the chariot. He drove on, and
            neither the sea nor the water-courses, nor the glens nor the
            mountain peaks stayed the deathless horses of <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span> Aidoneus, and soon the
            chariot was brought near to where Demeter awaited the coming of
            her daughter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style=

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And when,
            from a hilltop, Demeter saw the chariot approaching, she flew
            like a wild bird to clasp her child. Persephone, when she saw her
            mother’s dear eyes, sprang out of the chariot and fell upon her
            neck and embraced her. Long and long Demeter held her dear child
            in her arms, gazing, gazing upon her. Suddenly her mind misgave
            her. With a great fear at her heart she cried out: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Dearest, has any food passed your lips in all the
            time you have been in the Underworld?”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She had not
            tasted food in all the time she was there, Persephone said. And
            then, suddenly, she remembered the pomegranate that Aidoneus had
            asked her to divide. When she told that she had eaten seven seeds
            from it Demeter wept, and her tears fell upon Persephone’s
            face.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ah, my dearest,”</span> she cried, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“if you had not eaten the pomegranate seeds you could
            have stayed with me, and always we should have been together. But
            now that you have eaten food in it, the Underworld has a claim
            upon you. You may not stay always with me here. Again you will
            have to go back and dwell in the dark places under the earth and
            sit upon Aidoneus’s throne. But not always you will be there.
            When the flowers bloom upon the earth you shall come up from the
            realm of darkness, and in great joy we shall go through the world
            together, Demeter and Persephone.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And so it has
            been since Persephone came back to her mother <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span> after having eaten of the
            pomegranate seeds. For two seasons of the year she stays with
            Demeter, and for one season she stays in the Underworld with her
            dark lord. While she is with her mother there is springtime upon
            the earth. Demeter blesses the furrows, her heart being glad
            because her daughter is with her once more. The furrows become
            heavy with grain, and soon the whole wide earth has grain and
            fruit, leaves and flowers. When the furrows are reaped, when the
            grain has been gathered, when the dark season comes, Persephone
            goes from her mother, and going down into the dark places, she
            sits beside her mighty lord Aidoneus and upon his throne. Not
            sorrowful is she there; she sits with head unbowed, for she knows
            herself to be a mighty queen. She has joy, too, knowing of the
            seasons when she may walk with Demeter, her mother, on the wide
            places of the earth, through fields of flowers and fruit and
            ripening grain.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A day came
            when the heroes, on their way back from a journey they had made

            the prow of the ship, shouted angrily to them. Terrible did he
            seem to the Lemnian maidens, and they ran off, drawing the heroes
            with them. Heracles shouted to his comrades again, saying that if
            they did not come aboard the <em class=

            carry them to the ship, and force them again to take the oars in
            their hands. Not all of what Heracles said did the Argonauts
            hear.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That evening

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There are two
            Atalantas, she said; she herself, the Huntress, and another who
            is noted for her speed of foot and her delight in the race—the
            daughter of Schœneus, King of Bœotia, Atalanta of the Swift
            Foot.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So proud was
            she of her swiftness that she made a vow to the gods that none
            would be her husband except the youth who won past her in the
            race. Youth after youth came and raced against her, but Atalanta,
            who grew fleeter and fleeter of foot, left each one of them far
            behind her. The youths who came to the race were so many and the
            clamor they made after defeat was so great, that her father made
            a law that, as he thought, would lessen their number. The law
            that he made was that the youth who came to race against Atalanta
            and who lost the race should lose his life into the bargain.
            After that the youths who had care for their lives stayed away
            from Bœotia.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once there
            came a youth from a far part of Greece into the country that
            Atalanta’s father ruled over. Hippomenes was his name. He did not
            know of the race, but having come into <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page74">[pg 74]</span> the city and seeing the crowd of
            people, he went with them to the course. He looked upon the
            youths who were girded for the race, and he heard the folk say
            amongst themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“Poor youths, as
            mighty and as high-spirited as they look, by sunset the life will
            be out of each of them, for Atalanta will run past them as she
            ran past the others.”</span> Then Hippomenes spoke to the folk in
            wonder, and they told him of Atalanta’s race and of what would
            befall the youths who were defeated in it. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Unlucky youths,”</span> cried Hippomenes,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“how foolish they are to try to win a
            bride at the price of their lives.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, with
            pity in his heart, he watched the youths prepare for the race.
            Atalanta had not yet taken her place, and he was fearful of
            looking upon her. <span class="tei tei-q">“She is a
            witch,”</span> he said to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“she
            must be a witch to draw so many youths to their deaths, and she,
            no doubt, will show in her face and figure the witch’s
            spirit.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But even as
            he said this, Hippomenes saw Atalanta. She stood with the youths
            before they crouched for the first dart in the race. He saw that
            she was a girl of a light and a lovely form. Then they crouched
            for the race; then the trumpets rang out, and the youths and the
            maiden darted like swallows over the sand of the course.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On came
            Atalanta, far, far ahead of the youths who had started with her.
            Over her bare shoulders her hair streamed, blown backward by the
            wind that met her flight. Her fair neck shone, and her little
            feet were like flying doves. It seemed to Hippomenes as he
            watched her that there was fire in her <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page75">[pg 75]</span> lovely body. On and on she went as
            swift as the arrow that the Scythian shoots from his bow. And as
            he watched the race he was not sorry that the youths were being
            left behind. Rather would he have been enraged if one came near
            overtaking her, for now his heart was set upon winning her for
            his bride, and he cursed himself for not having entered the
            race.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She passed
            the last goal mark and she was given the victor’s wreath of
            flowers. Hippomenes stood and watched her and he did not see the
            youths who had started with her—they had thrown themselves on the
            ground in their despair.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then wild, as
            though he were one of the doomed youths, Hippomenes made his way
            through the throng and came before the black-bearded King of
            Bœtia. The king’s brows were knit, for even then he was
            pronouncing doom upon the youths who had been left behind in the
            race. He looked upon Hippomenes, another youth who would make the
            trial, and the frown became heavier upon his face.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But
            Hippomenes saw only Atalanta. She came beside her father; the
            wreath was upon her head of gold, and her eyes were wide and
            tender. She turned her face to him, and then she knew by the
            wildness that was in his look that he had come to enter the race
            with her. Then the flush that was on her face died away, and she
            shook her head as if she were imploring him to go from that
            place.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The
            dark-bearded king bent his brows upon him and said, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Speak, O youth, speak and tell us what brings you
            here.”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg
            76]</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then cried
            Hippomenes as if his whole life were bursting out with his words:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Why does this maiden, your daughter,
            seek an easy renown by conquering weakly youths in the race? She
            has not striven yet. Here stand I, one of the blood of Poseidon,
            the god of the sea. Should I be defeated by her in the race,
            then, indeed, might Atalanta have something to boast
            of.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Atalanta
            stepped forward and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not speak
            of it, youth. Indeed I think that it is some god, envious of your
            beauty and your strength, who sent you here to strive with me and
            to meet your doom. Ah, think of the youths who have striven with
            me even now! Think of the hard doom that is about to fall upon
            them! You venture your life in the race, but indeed I am not
            worthy of the price. Go hence, O stranger youth, go hence and
            live happily, for indeed I think that there is some maiden who
            loves you well.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Nay, maiden,”</span> said Hippomenes, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I will enter the race and I will venture my life on
            the chance of winning you for my bride. What good will my life
            and my spirit be to me if they cannot win this race for
            me?”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She drew away
            from him then and looked upon him no more, but bent down to
            fasten the sandals upon her feet. And the black-bearded king
            looked upon Hippomenes and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Face,
            then, this race to-morrow. You will be the only one who will
            enter it. But bethink thee of the doom that awaits thee at the
            end of it.”</span> The king said no more, and Hippomenes went
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span> from him and
            from Atalanta, and he came again to the place where the race had
            been run.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He looked
            across the sandy course with its goal marks, and in his mind he
            saw again Atalanta’s swift race. He would not meet doom at the
            hands of the king’s soldiers, he knew, for his spirit would leave
            him with the greatness of the effort he would make to reach the
            goal before her. And he thought it would be well to die in that
            effort and on that sandy place that was so far from his own
            land.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Even as he
            looked across the sandy course now deserted by the throng, he saw
            one move across it, coming toward him with feet that did not seem
            to touch the ground. She was a woman of wonderful presence. As
            Hippomenes looked upon her he knew that she was Aphrodite, the
            goddess of beauty and of love.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Hippomenes,”</span> said the immortal goddess,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the gods are mindful of you who are
            sprung from one of the gods, and I am mindful of you because of
            your own worth. I have come to help you in your race with
            Atalanta, for I would not have you slain, nor would I have that
            maiden go unwed. Give your greatest strength and your greatest
            swiftness to the race, and behold! here are wonders that will
            prevent the fleet-footed Atalanta from putting all her spirit
            into the race.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then the
            immortal goddess held out to Hippomenes a branch that had upon it
            three apples of shining gold.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“In Cyprus,”</span> said the goddess, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“where I have come from, there is a tree on which
            these golden apples grow. Only I <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page78">[pg 78]</span> may pluck them. I have brought them to
            you, Hippomenes. Keep them in your girdle, and in the race you
            will find out what to do with them, I think.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Aphrodite
            said, and then she vanished, leaving a fragrance in the air and
            the three shining apples in the hands of Hippomenes. Long he
            looked upon their brightness. They were beside him that night,
            and when he arose in the dawn he put them in his girdle. Then,
            before the throng, he went to the place of the race.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When he
            showed himself beside Atalanta all around the course were silent,
            for they all admired Hippomenes for his beauty and for the spirit
            that was in his face; they were silent out of compassion, for
            they knew the doom that befell the youths who raced with
            Atalanta.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now
            Schœneus, the black-bearded king, stood up, and he spoke to the
            throng, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear me all, both young
            and old: this youth, Hippomenes, seeks to win the race from my
            daughter, winning her for his bride. Now, if he be victorious and
            escape death I will give him my dear child, Atalanta, and many
            fleet horses besides as gifts from me, and in honor he shall go
            back to his native land. But if he fail in the race, then he will
            have to share the doom that has been meted out to the other
            youths who raced with Atalanta hoping to win her for a
            bride.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then
            Hippomenes and Atalanta crouched for the start. The trumpets were
            sounded and they darted off. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page79">[pg 79]</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Side by side
            with Atalanta Hippomenes went. Her flying hair touched his
            breast, and it seemed to him that they were skimming the sandy
            course as if they were swallows. But then Atalanta began to draw
            away from him. He saw her ahead of him, and then he began to hear
            the words of cheer that came from the throng—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Bend to the race, Hippomenes! Go on, go on! Use your
            strength to the utmost.”</span> He bent himself to the race, but
            further and further from him Atalanta drew.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then it
            seemed to him that she checked her swiftness a little to look
            back at him. He gained on her a little. And then his hand touched
            the apples that were in his girdle. As it touched them it came
            into his mind what to do with the apples.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He was not
            far from her now, but already her swiftness was drawing her
            further and further away. He took one of the apples into his hand
            and tossed it into the air so that it fell on the track before
            her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Atalanta saw
            the shining apple. She checked her speed and stooped in the race
            to pick it up. And as she stooped Hippomenes darted past her, and
            went flying toward the goal that now was within his sight.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But soon she
            was beside him again. He looked, and he saw that the goal marks
            were far, far ahead of him. Atalanta with the flying hair passed
            him, and drew away and away from him. He had not speed to gain
            upon her now, he thought, so he put his strength into his hand
            and he flung the second of the shining <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page80">[pg 80]</span> apples. The apple rolled before her
            and rolled off the course. Atalanta turned off the course,
            stooped and picked up the apple.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then did
            Hippomenes draw all his spirit into his breast as he raced on. He
            was now nearer to the goal than she was. But he knew that she was
            behind him, going lightly where he went heavily. And then she was
            beside him, and then she went past him. She paused in her speed
            for a moment and she looked back on him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As he raced
            on, his chest seemed weighted down and his throat was crackling
            dry. The goal marks were far away still, but Atalanta was nearing
            them. He took the last of the golden apples into his hand.
            Perhaps she was now so far that the strength of his throw would
            not be great enough to bring the apple before her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But with all
            the strength he could put into his hand he flung the apple. It
            struck the course before her feet and then went bounding wide.
            Atalanta swerved in her race and followed where the apple went.
            Hippomenes marveled that he had been able to fling it so far. He
            saw Atalanta stoop to pick up the apple, and he bounded on. And
            then, although his strength was failing, he saw the goal marks
            near him. He set his feet between them and then fell down on the
            ground.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The
            attendants raised him up and put the victor’s wreath upon his
            head. The concourse of people shouted with joy to see him victor.
            But he looked around for Atalanta and he <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page81">[pg 81]</span> saw her standing there with the golden
            apples in her hands. <span class="tei tei-q">“He has won,”</span>
            he heard her say, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I have not to hate
            myself for bringing a doom upon him. Gladly, gladly do I give up
            the race, and glad am I that it is this youth who has won the
            victory from me.”</span></p>

          when Heracles left the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          He gathered the heroes about him, and they, seeing Heracles come
          amongst them, clamored to go to hunt the wild bulls that were
          inland from the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So, for once,
          the heroes left the Lemnian maidens who were their friends. Jason,
          too, left Hypsipyle in the palace and went with Heracles. And as
          they went, Heracles spoke to each of the heroes, saying that they
          were forgetting the Fleece of Gold that they had sailed to gain.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span> Jason blushed
          to think that he had almost let go out of his mind the quest that
          had brought him from Iolcus. And then he thought upon Hypsipyle and
          of how her little hand would stay in his, and his own hand became
          loose upon the spear so that it nearly fell from him. How could he,
          he thought, leave Hypsipyle and this land of Lemnos behind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He heard the
          clear voice of Atalanta as she, too, spoke to the Argonauts. What
          Heracles said was brave and wise, said Atalanta. Forgetfulness
          would cover their names if they stayed longer in
          Lemnos—forgetfulness and shame, and they would come to despise
          themselves. Leave Lemnos, she cried, and draw <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          into the sea, and depart for Colchis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All day the
          Argonauts stayed by themselves, hunting the bulls. On their way
          back from the chase they were met by Lemnian maidens who carried
          wreaths of flowers for them. Very silent were the heroes as the
          maidens greeted them. Heracles went with Jason to the palace, and
          Hypsipyle, seeing the mighty stranger coming, seated herself, not
          on the couch where she was wont to sit looking into the face of
          Jason, but on the stone throne of King Thoas, her father. And
          seated on that throne she spoke to Jason and to Heracles as a queen
          might speak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In the hall
          that night the heroes and the Lemnian maidens who were with them

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Epimetheus
            the Titan had a brother who was the wisest of all
            beings—Prometheus called the Foreseer. But Epimetheus himself was
            slow-witted and scatter-brained. His wise brother once sent him a
            message bidding him beware of the gifts that Zeus might send him.
            Epimetheus heard, but he did not heed the warning, and thereby he
            brought upon the race of men troubles and cares.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Prometheus,
            the wise Titan, had saved men from a great trouble that Zeus
            would have brought upon them. Also he had given them the gift of
            fire. Zeus was the more wroth with men now because fire, stolen
            from him, had been given them; he was wroth with the race of
            Titans, too, and he pondered in his heart how he might injure
            men, and how he might use Epimetheus, the mindless Titan, to
            further his plan.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> While he
            pondered there was a hush on high Olympus, the mountain of the
            gods. Then Zeus called upon the artisan of the gods, lame
            Hephæstus, and he commanded him to make a being out of clay that
            would have the likeness of a lovely maiden. With joy and pride
            Hephæstus worked at the task that had been given him, and he
            fashioned a being that had the likeness of a lovely maiden, and
            he brought the thing of his making before the gods and the
            goddesses.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All strove to
            add a grace or a beauty to the work of Hephæstus. Zeus granted
            that the maiden should see and feel. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page84">[pg 84]</span> Athene dressed her in garments that were
            as lovely as flowers. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, put a charm
            on her lips and in her eyes. The Graces put necklaces around her
            neck and set a golden crown upon her head. The Hours brought her
            a girdle of spring flowers. Then the herald of the gods gave her
            speech that was sweet and flowing. All the gods and goddesses had
            given gifts to her, and for that reason the maiden of Hephæstus’s
            making was called Pandora, the All-endowed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She was
            lovely, the gods knew; not beautiful as they themselves are, who
            have a beauty that awakens reverence rather than love, but
            lovely, as flowers and bright waters and earthly maidens are
            lovely. Zeus smiled to himself when he looked upon her, and he
            called to Hermes who knew all the ways of the earth, and he put
            her into the charge of Hermes. Also he gave Hermes a great jar to
            take along; this jar was Pandora’s dower.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Epimetheus
            lived in a deep-down valley. Now one day, as he was sitting on a
            fallen pillar in the ruined place that was now forsaken by the
            rest of the Titans, he saw a pair coming toward him. One had
            wings, and he knew him to be Hermes, the messenger of the gods.
            The other was a maiden. Epimetheus marveled at the crown upon her
            head and at her lovely garments. There was a glint of gold all
            around her. He rose from where he sat upon the broken pillar and
            he stood to watch the pair. Hermes, he saw, was carrying by its
            handle a great jar.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em">  <span class=

            looked upon the maiden. Epimetheus had seen no lovely thing for
            ages. Wonderful indeed was this Golden Maid, and as she came
            nearer the charm that was on her lips and in her eyes came to the
            Earth-born One, and he smiled with more and more delight.</p>

            and stood before him. He also smiled, but his smile had something
            baleful in it. He put the hands of the Golden Maid into the great
            soft hand of the Titan, and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
            Epimetheus, Father Zeus would be reconciled with thee, and as a

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Oh, very
            foolish was Epimetheus the Earth-born One! As he looked upon the

            He took the hands of Pandora, and he thought of nothing at all in
            all the world but her. Very far away seemed the voice of Hermes
            saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“This jar, too, is from Olympus;
            it has in it Pandora’s dower.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The jar stood
            forgotten for long, and green plants grew over it while
            Epimetheus walked in the garden with the Golden Maid, or watched
            her while she gazed on herself in the stream, or searched in the
            untended places for the fruits that the Elder Gods would eat,
            when they feasted with the Titans in the old days, before Zeus
            had come to his power. And lost to Epimetheus <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span> was the memory of his
            brother now suffering upon the rock because of the gift he had
            given to men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Pandora,
            knowing nothing except the brightness of the sunshine and the
            lovely shapes and colors of things and the sweet taste of the
            fruits that Epimetheus brought to her, could have stayed forever
            in that garden.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But every day
            Epimetheus would think that the men and women of the world should
            be able to talk to him about this maiden with the wonderful
            radiance of gold, and with the lovely garments, and the marvelous
            crown. And one day he took Pandora by the hand, and he brought
            her out of that deep-lying valley, and toward the homes of men.
            He did not forget the jar that Hermes had left with her. All
            things that belonged to the Golden Maid were precious, and
            Epimetheus took the jar along.</p>

            <div class="tei tei-tb">
              &nbsp;
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The race of
            men at the time were simple and content. Their days were passed
            in toil, but now, since Prometheus had given them fire, they had
            good fruits of their toil. They had well-shaped tools to dig the
            earth and to build houses. Their homes were warmed with fire, and
            fire burned upon the altars that were upon their ways.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Greatly they
            reverenced Prometheus; who had given them fire, and greatly they
            reverenced the race of the Titans. So when Epimetheus came
            amongst them, tall as a man walking with stilts, they welcomed
            him and brought him and the Golden <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page87">[pg 87]</span> Maid to their hearths. And Epimetheus
            showed Pandora the wonderful element that his brother had given
            to men, and she rejoiced to see the fire, clapping her hands with
            delight. The jar that Epimetheus brought he left in an open
            place.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In carrying
            it up the rough ways out of the valley Epimetheus may have
            knocked the jar about, for the lid that had been tight upon it
            now fitted very loosely. But no one gave heed to the jar as it
            stood in the open space where Epimetheus had left it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> At first the
            men and women looked upon the beauty of Pandora, upon her lovely
            dresses, and her golden crown and her girdle of flowers, with
            wonder and delight. Epimetheus would have every one admire and
            praise her. The men would leave off working in the fields, or
            hammering on iron, or building houses, and the women would leave
            off spinning or weaving, and come at his call, and stand about
            and admire the Golden Maid. But as time went by a change came
            upon the women: one woman would weep, and another would look
            angry, and a third would go back sullenly to her work when
            Pandora was admired or praised.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once the
            women were gathered together, and one who was the wisest amongst
            them said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Once we did not think about
            ourselves, and we were content. But now we think about ourselves,
            and we say to ourselves that we are harsh and ill-favored indeed
            compared to the Golden Maid that the Titan is so enchanted with.
            And we hate to see our own men praise and <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span> admire her, and often, in
            our hearts, we would destroy her if we could.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“That is true,”</span> the women said. And then a
            young woman cried out in a most yearnful voice, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“O tell us, you who are wise, how can we make
            ourselves as beautiful as Pandora!”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said
            that woman who was thought to be wise, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“This Golden Maid is lovely to look upon because she
            has lovely apparel and all the means of keeping herself lovely.
            The gods have given her the ways, and so her skin remains fair,
            and her hair keeps its gold, and her lips are ever red and her
            eyes shining. And I think that the means that she has of keeping
            lovely are all in that jar that Epimetheus brought with
            her.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the
            woman who was thought to be wise said this, those around her were
            silent for a while. But then one arose and another arose, and
            they stood and whispered together, one saying to the other that
            they should go to the place where the jar had been left by
            Epimetheus, and that they should take out of it the salves and
            the charms and the washes that would leave them as beautiful as
            Pandora.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So the women
            went to that place. On their way they stopped at a pool and they
            bent over to see themselves mirrored in it, and they saw
            themselves with dusty and unkempt hair, with large and knotted
            hands, with troubled eyes, and with anxious mouths. They frowned
            as they looked upon their images, and they said in harsh voices
            that in a while they would have ways of making themselves as
            lovely as the Golden Maid. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And as they
            went on they saw Pandora. She was playing in a flowering field,
            while Epimetheus, high as a man upon stilts, went gathering the
            blossoms of the bushes for her. They went on, and they came at
            last to the place where Epimetheus had left the jar that held
            Pandora’s dower.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A great stone
            jar it was; there was no bird, nor flower, nor branch painted
            upon it. It stood high as a woman’s shoulder. And as the women
            looked on it they thought that there were things enough in it to
            keep them beautiful for all the days of their lives. But each one
            thought that she should not be the last to get her hands into
            it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once the lid
            had been fixed tightly down on the jar. But the lid was shifted a
            little now. As the hands of the women grasped it to take off the
            lid the jar was cast down, and the things that were inside
            spilled themselves forth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were
            black and gray and red; they were crawling and flying things.
            And, as the women looked, the things spread themselves abroad or
            fastened themselves upon them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The jar, like
            Pandora herself, had been made and filled out of the ill will of
            Zeus. And it had been filled, not with salves and charms and
            washes, as the women had thought, but with Cares and Troubles.
            Before the women came to it one Trouble had already come forth
            from the jar—Self-thought that was upon the top of the heap. It
            was Self-thought that had afflicted the women, making them
            troubled about their own looks, and envious of the graces of the
            Golden Maid. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg
            90]</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now the
            others spread themselves out—Sickness and War and Strife between
            friends. They spread themselves abroad and entered the houses,
            while Epimetheus, the mindless Titan, gathered flowers for
            Pandora, the Golden Maid.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Lest she
            should weary of her play he called to her. He would take her into
            the houses of men. As they drew near to the houses they saw a
            woman seated on the ground, weeping; her husband had suddenly
            become hard to her and had shut the door on her face. They came
            upon a child crying because of a pain that he could not
            understand. And then they found two men struggling, their strife
            being on account of a possession that they had both held
            peaceably before.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In every
            house they went to Epimetheus would say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I am the brother of Prometheus, who gave you the
            gift of fire.”</span> But instead of giving them a welcome the
            men would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We know nothing about
            your relation to Prometheus. We see you as a foolish man upon
            stilts.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Epimetheus
            was troubled by the hard looks and the cold words of the men who
            once had reverenced him. He turned from the houses and went away.
            In a quiet place he sat down, and for a while he lost sight of
            Pandora. And then it seemed to him that he heard the voice of his
            wise and suffering brother saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do
            not accept any gift that Zeus may send you.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He rose up
            and he hurried away from that place, leaving Pandora playing by
            herself. There came into his scattered mind Regret and Fear. As
            he went on he stumbled. He fell <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page91">[pg 91]</span> from the edge of a cliff, and the sea
            washed away the body of the mindless brother of Prometheus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Not
            everything had been spilled out of the jar that had been brought
            with Pandora into the world of men. A beautiful, living thing was
            in that jar also. This was Hope. And this beautiful, living thing
            had got caught under the rim of the jar and had not come forth
            with the others. One day a weeping woman found Hope under the rim
            of Pandora’s jar and brought this living thing into the house of
            men. And now because of Hope they could see an end to their
            troubles. And the men and women roused themselves in the midst of
            their afflictions and they looked toward gladness. Hope, that had
            been caught under the rim of the jar, stayed behind the
            thresholds of their houses.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As for
            Pandora, the Golden Maid, she played on, knowing only the
            brightness of the sunshine and the lovely shapes of things.
            Beautiful would she have seemed to any being who saw her, but now
            she had strayed away from the houses of men and Epimetheus was
            not there to look upon her. Then Hephæstus, the lame artisan of
            the gods, left down his tools and went to seek her. He found
            Pandora, and he took her back to Olympus. And in his brazen house
            she stays, though sometimes at the will of Zeus she goes down
            into the world of men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When
            Polydeuces had ended the story that Castor had begun, Heracles
            cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">“For the Argonauts, too, there
            has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span> a
            Golden Maid—nay, not one, but a Golden Maid for each. Out of the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Heracles
            said, and he went from Hypsipyle’s hall. The heroes looked at
            each other, and they stood up, and shame that they had stayed so
            long away from the quest came over each of them. The maidens took
            their hands; the heroes unloosed those soft hands and turned away
            from them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Hypsipyle
            left the throne of King Thoas and stood before Jason. There was a
            storm in all her body; her mouth was shaken, and a whole life’s
            trouble was in her great eyes. Before she spoke Jason cried out:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What Heracles said is true, O Argonauts!
            On the Quest of the Golden Fleece our lives and our honors
            depend. To Colchis—to Colchis must we go!”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He stood
            upright in the hall, and his comrades gathered around him. The

            made their partings long delayed, but that a strange cry came to
            them through the night. Well did the Argonauts know that cry—it
            was the cry of the ship, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            they must go to her now or stay from the voyage for ever. And the
            maidens knew that there was something in the cry of the ship that
            might not be gainsaid, and they put their hands before their

            Jason’s voyage as he had told of them, and of all that he would
            have to pass through. When the other Lemnian women slept she put
            her head upon her nurse’s knees and wept; bitterly Hypsipyle

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She showed a

          near Salmydessus, where Phineus, the wise king, ruled, and they
          sailed past it; they sighted the pile of stones, with the oar
          upright upon it that they had raised on the seashore over the body
          of Tiphys, the skillful steersman whom they had lost; they sailed
          on until they heard a sound that grew more and more thunderous, and
          then the heroes said to each other, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we
          come to the Symplegades and the dread passage into the Sea of
          Pontus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
          that Jason cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, when Pelias
          spoke of this quest to me, why did I not turn my head away and
          refuse to be drawn into it? Since we came near the dread passage
          that is before us I have passed every night in groans. As for you
          who have come with me, you may take your ease, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span> for you need care only for
          your own lives. But I have to care for you all, and to strive to
          win for you all a safe return to Greece. Ah, greatly am I afflicted
          now, knowing to what a great peril I have brought you!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Jason said,
          thinking to make trial of the heroes. They, on their part, were not
          dismayed, but shouted back cheerful words to him. Then he said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O friends of mine, by your spirit my
          spirit is quickened. Now if I knew that I was being borne down into
          the black gulfs of Hades, I should fear nothing, knowing that you
          are constant and faithful of heart.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As he said this
          they came into water that seethed all around the ship. Then into
          the hands of Euphemus, a youth of Iolcus, who was the keenest-eyed
          amongst the Argonauts, Jason put the pigeon that Hypsipyle had
          given him. He bade him stand by the prow of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>,
          ready to loose the pigeon as the ship came nigh that dreadful gate
          of rock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They saw the
          spray being dashed around in showers; they saw the sea spread
          itself out in foam; they saw the high, black rocks rush together,
          sounding thunderously as they met. The caves in the high rocks
          rumbled as the sea surged into them, and the foam of the dashing
          waves spurted high up the rocks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason shouted
          to each man to grip hard on the oars. The <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          dashed on as the rocks rushed toward each other again. Then there
          was such noise that no man’s voice could be heard above it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As the rocks
          met, Euphemus loosed the pigeon. With his <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page96">[pg 96]</span> keen eyes he watched her fly through the
          spray. Would she, not finding an opening to fly through, turn back?
          He watched, and meanwhile the Argonauts gripped hard on the oars to
          save the ship from being dashed on the rocks. The pigeon fluttered
          as though she would sink down and let the spray drown her. And then
          Euphemus saw her raise herself and fly forward. Toward the place
          where she had flown he pointed. The rowers gave a loud cry, and
          Jason called upon them to pull with might and main.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The rocks were
          parting asunder, and to the right and left broad Pontus was seen by
          the heroes. Then suddenly a huge wave rose before them, and at the
          sight of it they all uttered a cry and bent their heads. It seemed
          to them that it would dash down on the whole ship’s length and
          overwhelm them all. But Nauplius was quick to ease the ship, and
          the wave rolled away beneath the keel, and at the stern it raised
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> and dashed her away from the
          rocks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They felt the
          sun as it streamed upon them through the sundered rocks. They
          strained at the oars until the oars bent like bows in their hands.
          The ship sprang forward. Surely they were now in the wide Sea of
          Pontus!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          shouted. They saw the rocks behind them with the sea fowl screaming
          upon them. Surely they were in the Sea of Pontus—the sea that had
          never been entered before through the Rocks Wandering. The rocks no
          longer dashed together; each remained fixed in its place, for it
          was the will of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span>
          the gods that these rocks should no more clash together after a
          mortal’s ship had passed between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were now
          in the Sea of Pontus, the sea into which flowed the river that
          Colchis was upon—the River Phasis. And now above Jason’s head the

          knew that this was a sign from the gods that the voyage would not
          any more be troublous.</p>

          in the harbor of Thynias, the desert island, and sailing from there
          they came to the land of the Mariandyni, a people who were
          constantly at war with the Bebrycians; there the hero Polydeuces
          was welcomed as a god. Twelve days afterward they passed the mouth
          of the River Callichorus; then they came to the mouth of that river
          that flows through the land of the Amazons, the River Thermodon.
          Fourteen days from that place brought them to the island that is
          filled with the birds of Ares, the god of war. These birds dropped
          upon the heroes heavy, pointed feathers that would have pierced
          them as arrows if they had not covered themselves with their
          shields; then by shouting, and by striking their shields with their
          spears, they raised such a clamor as drove the birds away.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They sailed on,
          borne by a gentle breeze, until a gulf of the sea opened before

          Orpheus, looking on its peak and its crags, said, <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> For upon that
          mountain the Titan god was held, his limbs bound upon the hard
          rocks by fetters of bronze. Even as the Argonauts looked toward the
          mountain a great shadow fell upon their ship, and looking up they
          saw a monstrous bird flying. The beat of the bird’s wings filled
          out the sail and drove the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> swiftly onward. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is the bird sent by Zeus,”</span> Orpheus said.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“It is the vulture that every day devours
          the liver of the Titan god.”</span> They cowered down on the ship
          as they heard that word—all the Argonauts save Heracles; he stood
          upright and looked out toward where the bird was flying. Then, as
          the bird came near to the mountain, the Argonauts heard a great cry
          of anguish go up from the rocks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is Prometheus crying out as the bird of Zeus flies

          down on the ship, all save Heracles, who stayed looking toward
          where the great vulture had flown.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The night came
          and the Argonauts sailed on in silence, thinking in awe of the

          on under the stars, Orpheus told them of Prometheus, of his gift to

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The gods more
            than once made a race of men: the first was a Golden Race. Very
            close to the gods who dwell on Olympus was this Golden Race; they
            lived justly although there were no laws to compel them. In the
            time of the Golden Race the earth knew only one season, and that
            season was everlasting Spring. The men and women of the Golden
            Race lived through a span of life that was far beyond that of the
            men and women of our day, and when they died it was as though
            sleep had become everlasting with them. They had all good things,
            and that without labor, for the earth without any forcing
            bestowed fruits and crops upon them. They had peace all through
            their lives, this Golden Race, and after they had passed away
            their spirits remained above the earth, inspiring the men of the
            race that came after them to do great and gracious things and to
            act justly and kindly to one another.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> After the
            Golden Race had passed away, the gods made for the earth a second
            race—a Silver Race. Less noble in spirit and in body was this
            Silver Race, and the seasons that visited them were less
            gracious. In the time of the Silver Race the gods made the
            seasons—Summer and Spring, and Autumn <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page100">[pg 100]</span> and Winter. They knew parching heat,
            and the bitter winds of winter, and snow and rain and hail. It
            was the men of the Silver Race who first built houses for
            shelter. They lived through a span of life that was longer than
            our span, but it was not long enough to give wisdom to them.
            Children were brought up at their mothers’ sides for a hundred
            years, playing at childish things. And when they came to years
            beyond a hundred they quarreled with one another, and wronged one
            another, and did not know enough to give reverence to the
            immortal gods. Then, by the will of Zeus, the Silver Race passed
            away as the Golden Race had passed away. Their spirits stay in
            the Underworld, and they are called by men the blessed spirits of
            the Underworld.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then
            there was made the third race—the Race of Bronze. They were a
            race great of stature, terrible and strong. Their armor was of
            bronze, their swords were of bronze, their implements were of
            bronze, and of bronze, too, they made their houses. No great span
            of life was theirs, for with the weapons that they took in their
            terrible hands they slew one another. Thus they passed away, and
            went down under the earth to Hades, leaving no name that men
            might know them by.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the gods
            created a fourth race—our own: a Race of Iron. We have not the
            justice that was amongst the men of the Golden Race, nor the
            simpleness that was amongst the men of the Silver Race, nor the
            stature nor the great strength that the men of the Bronze Race
            possessed. We are of iron that we <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page101">[pg 101]</span> may endure. It is our doom that we must
            never cease from labor and that we must very quickly grow
            old.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But miserable
            as we are to-day, there was a time when the lot of men was more
            miserable. With poor implements they had to labor on a hard
            ground. There was less justice and kindliness amongst men in
            those days than there is now.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once it came
            into the mind of Zeus that he would destroy the fourth race and
            leave the earth to the nymphs and the satyrs. He would destroy it
            by a great flood. But Prometheus, the Titan god who had given aid
            to Zeus against the other Titans—Prometheus, who was called the
            Foreseer—could not consent to the race of men being destroyed
            utterly, and he considered a way of saving some of them. To a man
            and a woman, Deucalion and Pyrrha, just and gentle people, he
            brought word of the plan of Zeus, and he showed them how to make
            a ship that would bear them through what was about to be sent
            upon the earth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Zeus
            shut up in their cave all the winds but the wind that brings rain
            and clouds. He bade this wind, the South Wind, sweep over the
            earth, flooding it with rain. He called upon Poseidon and bade
            him to let the sea pour in upon the land. And Poseidon commanded
            the rivers to put forth all their strength, and sweep dykes away,
            and overflow their banks.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The clouds
            and the sea and the rivers poured upon the earth. The flood rose
            higher and higher, and in the places where the pretty lambs had
            played the ugly sea calves now gambolled; <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span> men in their boats drew
            fishes out of the tops of elm trees, and the water nymphs were
            amazed to come on men’s cities under the waves.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Soon even the
            men and women who had boats were overwhelmed by the rise of
            water—all perished then except Deucalion and Pyrrha, his wife;
            them the waves had not overwhelmed, for they were in a ship that
            Prometheus had shown them how to build. The flood went down at
            last, and Deucalion and Pyrrha climbed up to a high and a dry
            ground. Zeus saw that two of the race of men had been left alive.
            But he saw that these two were just and kindly, and had a right
            reverence for the gods. He spared them, and he saw their children
            again peopling the earth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Prometheus,
            who had saved them, looked on the men and women of the earth with
            compassion. Their labor was hard, and they wrought much to gain
            little. They were chilled at night in their houses, and the winds
            that blew in the daytime made the old men and women bend double
            like a wheel. Prometheus thought to himself that if men and women
            had the element that only the gods knew of—the element of
            fire—they could make for themselves implements for labor; they
            could build houses that would keep out the chilling winds, and
            they could warm themselves at the blaze.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the gods
            had not willed that men should have fire, and to go against the
            will of the gods would be impious. Prometheus went against the
            will of the gods. He stole fire from the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page103">[pg 103]</span> altar of Zeus, and he hid it in a
            hollow fennel stalk, and he brought it to men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then men were
            able to hammer iron into tools, and cut down forests with axes,
            and sow grain where the forests had been. Then were they able to
            make houses that the storms could not overthrow, and they were
            able to warm themselves at hearth fires. They had rest from their
            labor at times. They built cities; they became beings who no
            longer had heads and backs bent but were able to raise their
            faces even to the gods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Zeus
            spared the race of men who had now the sacred element of fire.
            But he knew that Prometheus had stolen this fire even from his
            own altar and had given it to men. And he thought on how he might
            punish the great Titan god for his impiety.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He brought
            back from the Underworld the giants that he had put there to
            guard the Titans that had been hurled down to Tartarus. He
            brought back Gyes, Cottus, and Briareus, and he commanded them to
            lay hands upon Prometheus and to fasten him with fetters to the
            highest, blackest crag upon Caucasus. And Briareus, Cottus, and
            Gyes seized upon the Titan god, and carried him to Caucasus, and
            fettered him with fetters of bronze to the highest, blackest
            crag—with fetters of bronze that may not be broken. There they
            have left the Titan stretched, under the sky, with the cold winds
            blowing upon him, and with the sun streaming down on him. And
            that his punishment might exceed all other punishments Zeus had
            sent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span> a
            vulture to prey upon him—a vulture that tears at his liver each
            day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And yet
            Prometheus does not cry out that he has repented of his gift to
            man; although the winds blow upon him, and the sun streams upon
            him, and the vulture tears at his liver, Prometheus will not cry
            out his repentance to heaven. And Zeus may not utterly destroy
            him. For Prometheus the Foreseer knows a secret that Zeus would
            fain have him disclose. He knows that even as Zeus overthrew his
            father and made himself the ruler in his stead, so, too, another
            will overthrow Zeus. And one day Zeus will have to have the
            fetters broken from around the limbs of Prometheus, and will have
            to bring from the rock and the vulture, and into the Council of
            the Olympians, the unyielding Titan god.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
            was very near to the Mountain Caucasus. The voyagers looked in
            awe upon its black crags. They saw the great vulture circling
            over a high rock, and from beneath where the vulture circled they
            heard a weary cry. Then Heracles, who all night had stood by the
            mast, cried out to the Argonauts to bring the ship near to a
            landing place.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Jason
            would not have them go near; fear of the wrath of Zeus was strong
            upon him; rather, he bade the Argonauts put all their strength
            into their rowing, and draw far off from that forbidden mountain.
            Heracles, not heeding what Jason <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page105">[pg 105]</span> ordered, declared that it was his
            purpose to make his way up to the black crag, and, with his
            shield and his sword in his hands, slay the vulture that preyed
            upon the liver of Prometheus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Orpheus
            in a clear voice spoke to the Argonauts. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Surely some spirit possesses Heracles,”</span> he
            said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Despite all we do or say he will
            make his way to where Prometheus is fettered to the rock. Do not
            gainsay him in this! Remember what Nereus, the ancient one of the
            sea, declared! Did Nereus not say that a great labor awaited
            Heracles, and that in the doing of it he should work out the will
            of Zeus? Stay him not! How just it would be if he who is the son
            of Zeus freed from his torments the much-enduring Titan
            god!”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Orpheus
            said in his clear, commanding voice. They drew near to the
            Mountain Caucasus. Then Heracles, gripping the sword and shield
            that were the gifts of the gods, sprang out on the landing place.
            The Argonauts shouted farewell to him. But he, filled as he was
            with an overmastering spirit, did not heed their words.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A strong
            breeze drove them onward; darkness came down, and the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
            went on through the night. With the morning light those who were
            sleeping were awakened by the cry of Nauplius—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Lo! The Phasis, and the utmost bourne of the
            sea!”</span> They sprang up, and looked with many strange
            feelings upon the broad river they had come to.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Here was the
            Phasis emptying itself into the Sea of Pontus! Up that river was
            Colchis and the city of King Æetes, the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page106">[pg 106]</span> end of their voyage, the place where
            was kept the Golden Fleece! Quickly they let down the sail; they
            lowered the mast and they laid it along the deck; strongly they
            grasped the oars; they swung the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
            around, and they entered the broad stream of the Phasis.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Up the river
            they went with the Mountain Caucasus on their left hand, and on
            their right the groves and gardens of Aea, King Æetes’s city. As
            they went up the stream, Jason poured from a golden cup an
            offering to the gods. And to the dead heroes of that country the
            Argonauts prayed for good fortune to their enterprise.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was
            Jason’s counsel that they should not at once appear before King
            Æetes, but visit him after they had seen the strength of his
            city. They drew their ship into a shaded backwater, and there
            they stayed while day grew and faded around them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Night came,
            and the heroes slept upon the deck of <em class=

            Many things came back to them in their dreams or through their
            half-sleep: they thought of the Lemnian maidens they had parted
            from; of the Clashing Rocks they had passed between; of the look
            in the eyes of Heracles as he raised his face to the high, black
            peak of Caucasus. They slept, and they thought they saw before
            them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">The Golden Fleece</span></span>;
            darkness surrounded it; it seemed to the dreaming Argonauts that

            possessed.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg

          come into a country that was the strangest of all countries, and
          amongst a people that were the strangest of all peoples. They were
          in the land, this people said, before the moon had come into the
          sky. And it is true that when the great king of Egypt had come so
          far, finding in all other places men living on the high hills and
          eating the acorns that grew on the oaks there, he found in Colchis
          the city of Aea with a wall around it and with pillars on which
          writings were graven. That was when Egypt was called the Morning
          Land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And many of the
          magicians of Egypt who had come with King Sesostris stayed in that
          city of Aea, and they taught people spells that could stay the moon
          in her going and coming, in her rising and setting. Priests of the
          Moon ruled the city of Aea until King Æetes came.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Æetes had no
          need of their magic, for Helios, the bright Sun, was his father, as
          he thought. Also, Hephæstus, the artisan of the gods, was his
          friend, and Hephæstus made for him <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page110">[pg 110]</span> many wonderful things to be his
          protection. Medea, too, his wise daughter, knew the secrets taught
          by those who could sway the moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Æetes once
          was made afraid by a dream that he had: he dreamt that a ship had
          come up the Phasis, and then, sailing on a mist, had rammed his
          palace that was standing there in all its strength and beauty until
          it had fallen down. On the morning of the night that he had had
          this dream Æetes called Medea, his wise daughter, and he bade her
          go to the temple of Hecate, the Moon, and search out spells that
          might destroy those who came against his city.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That morning
          the Argonauts, who had passed the night in the backwater of the
          river, had two youths come to them. They were in a broken ship, and
          they had one oar only. When Jason, after giving them food and fresh
          garments, questioned them, he found out that these youths were of
          the city of Aea, and that they were none others than the sons of
          Phrixus—of Phrixus who had come there with the Golden Ram.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And the youths,
          Phrontis and Melas, were as amazed as was Jason when they found out
          whose ship they had come aboard. For Jason was the grandson of
          Cretheus, and Cretheus was the brother of Athamas, their
          grandfather. They had ventured from Aea, where they had been
          reared, thinking to reach the country of Athamas and lay claim to
          his possessions. But they had been wrecked at a place not far from
          the mouth of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
          111]</span> Phasis, and with great pain and struggle they had made
          their way back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were
          fearful of Aea and of their uncle King Æetes, and they would gladly
          go with Jason and the Argonauts back to Greece. They would help
          Jason, they said, to persuade Æetes to give the Golden Fleece
          peaceably to them. Their mother was the daughter of
          Æetes—Chalciope, whom the king had given in marriage to Phrixus,
          his guest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A council of
          the Argonauts was held, and it was agreed that Jason should go with
          two comrades to King Æetes, Phrontis and Melas going also. They
          were to ask the king to give them the Golden Fleece and to offer
          him a recompense. Jason took Peleus and Telamon with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As they came to
          the city a mist fell, and Jason and his comrades with the sons of
          Phrixus went through the city without being seen. They came before
          the palace of King Æetes. Then Phrontis and Melas were some way
          behind. The mist lifted, and before the heroes was the wonder of
          the palace in the bright light of the morning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Vines with
          broad leaves and heavy clusters of fruit grew from column to
          column, the columns holding a gallery up. And under the vines were
          the four fountains that Hephæstus had made for King Æetes. They
          gushed out into golden, silver, bronze, and iron basins. And one
          fountain gushed out clear water, and another gushed out milk;
          another gushed out wine; and another oil. On each side of the
          courtyard were the palace <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
          112]</span> buildings; in one King Æetes lived with Apsyrtus, his
          son, and in the other Chalciope and Medea lived with their
          handmaidens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea was
          passing from her father’s house. The mist lifted suddenly and she
          saw three strangers in the palace courtyard. One had a crimson
          mantle on; his shoulders were such as to make him seem a man that a
          whole world could not overthrow, and his eyes had all the sun’s
          light in them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Amazed, Medea
          stood looking upon Jason, wondering at his bright hair and gleaming
          eyes and at the lightness and strength of the hand that he had
          raised. And then a dove flew toward her: it was being chased by a
          hawk, and Medea saw the hawk’s eyes and beak. As the dove lighted
          upon her shoulder she threw her veil around it, and the hawk dashed
          itself against a column. And as Medea, trembling, leaned against
          the column she heard a cry from her sister, who was within.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> For now
          Phrontis and Melas had come up, and Chalciope who was spinning by
          the door saw them and cried out. All the servants rushed out.
          Seeing Chalciope’s sons there they, too, uttered loud cries, and
          made such commotion that Apsyrtus and then King Æetes came out of
          the palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason saw King
          Æetes. He was old and white, but he had great green eyes, and the
          strength of a leopard was in all he did. And Jason looked upon
          Apsyrtus too; the son of Æetes looked like a Phænician merchant,
          black of beard and with rings in his ears, with a hooked nose and a
          gleam of copper in his face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Phrontis and
          Melas went from their mother’s embrace and <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page113">[pg 113]</span> made reverence to King Æetes. Then
          they spoke of the heroes who were with them, of Jason and his two
          comrades. Æetes bade all enter the palace; baths were made ready
          for them, and a banquet was prepared.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> After the
          banquet, when they all sat together, Æetes, addressing the eldest
          of Chalciope’s sons, said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sons of Phrixus, of that man whom I honored above all
          men who came to my halls, speak now and tell me how it is that you
          have come back to Aea so soon, and who they are, these men who come
          with you?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Æetes, as he
          spoke, looked sharply upon Phrontis and Melas, for he suspected
          them of having returned to Aea, bringing these armed men with them,
          with an evil intent. Phrontis looked at the King, and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Æetes, our ship was driven upon the Island of Ares,
          where it was almost broken upon the rocks. That was on a murky
          night, and in the morning the birds of Ares shot their sharp
          feathers upon us. We pulled away from that place, and thereafter we
          were driven by the winds back to the mouth of the Phasis. There we
          met with these heroes who were friendly to us. Who they are, what
          they have come to your city for, I shall now tell you.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A certain king, longing to drive one of these heroes
          from his land, and hoping that the race of Cretheus might perish
          utterly, led him to enter a most perilous adventure. He came here
          upon a ship that was made by the command of Hera, the wife of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span> Zeus, a ship
          more wonderful than mortals ever sailed in before. With him there
          came the mightiest of the heroes of Greece. He is Jason, the
          grandson of Cretheus, and he has come to beg that you will grant
          him freely the famous Fleece of Gold that Phrixus brought to
          Aea.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But not without recompense to you would he take the
          Fleece. Already he has heard of your bitter foes, the Sauromatæ. He
          with his comrades would subdue them for you. And if you would ask
          of the names and the lineage of the heroes who are with Jason I
          shall tell you. This is Peleus and this is Telamon; they are
          brothers, and they are sons of Æacus, who was of the seed of Zeus.
          And all the other heroes who have come with them are of the seed of
          the gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Phrontis
          said, but the King was not placated by what he said. He thought
          that the sons of Chalciope had returned to Aea bringing these
          warriors with them so that they might wrest the kingship from him,
          or, failing that, plunder the city. Æetes’s heart was filled with
          wrath as he looked upon them, and his eyes shone as a leopard’s
          eyes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Begone from my sight,”</span> he cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“robbers that ye are! Tricksters! If you had not eaten
          at my table, assuredly I should have had your tongues cut out for
          speaking falsehoods about the blessed gods, saying that this one
          and that of your companions was of their divine race.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Telamon and
          Peleus strode forward with angry hearts; they would have laid their
          hands upon King Æetes only Jason held <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page115">[pg 115]</span> them back. And then speaking to the king
          in a quiet voice, Jason said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bear with us, King Æetes, I pray you. We have not come
          with such evil intent as you think. Ah, it was the evil command of
          an evil king that sent me forth with these companions of mine
          across dangerous gulfs of the sea, and to face your wrath and the
          armed men you can bring against us. We are ready to make great
          recompense for the friendliness you may show to us. We will subdue
          for you the Sauromatæ, or any other people that you would lord it
          over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Æetes was
          not made friendly by Jason’s words. His heart was divided as to
          whether he should summon his armed men and have them slain upon the
          spot, or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he
          would make of them. At last he thought that it would be better to
          put them to the trial that he had in mind, slaying them afterward
          if need be. And then he spoke to Jason, saying:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Strangers to Colchis, it may be true what my nephews
          have said. It may be that ye are truly of the seed of the
          immortals. And it may be that I shall give you the Golden Fleece to
          bear away after I have made trial of you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As he spoke
          Medea, brought there by his messenger so that she might observe the
          strangers, came into the chamber. She entered softly and she stood
          away from her father and the four who were speaking with him. Jason
          looked upon her, and even although his mind was filled with the
          thought of bending King <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg
          116]</span> Æetes to his will, he saw what manner of maiden she
          was, and what beauty and what strength was hers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She had a dark
          face that was made very strange by her crown of golden hair. Her
          eyes, like her father’s, were wide and full of light, and her lips
          were so full and red that they made her mouth like an opening rose.
          But her brows were always knit as if there was some secret anger
          within her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“With brave men I have no quarrel,”</span> said Æetes.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will make a trial of your bravery, and
          if your bravery wins through the trial, be very sure that you will
          have the Golden Fleece to bring back in triumph to
          Iolcus.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But the trial that I would make of you is hard for a
          great hero even. Know that on the plain of Ares yonder I have two
          fire-breathing bulls with feet of brass. These bulls were once
          conquered by me; I yoked them to a plow of adamant, and with them I
          plowed the field of Ares for four plow-gates. Then I sowed the
          furrows, not with the seed that Demeter gives, but with teeth of a
          dragon. And from the dragon’s teeth that I sowed in the field of
          Ares armed men sprang up. I slew them with my spear as they rose
          around me to slay me. If you can accomplish this that I
          accomplished in days gone by I shall submit to you and give you the
          Golden Fleece. But if you cannot accomplish what I once
          accomplished you shall go from my city empty-handed, for it is not
          right that a brave man should yield aught to one who cannot show
          himself as brave.”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
          117]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Æetes said.
          Then Jason, utterly confounded, cast his eyes upon the ground. He
          raised them to speak to the king, and as he did he found the
          strange eyes of Medea upon him. With all the courage that was in
          him he spoke:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will dare this contest, monstrous as it is. I will
          face this doom. I have come far, and there is nothing else for me
          to do but to yoke your fire-breathing bulls to the plow of adamant,
          and plow the furrows in the field of Ares, and struggle with the
          Earth-born Men.”</span> As he said this he saw the eyes of Medea
          grow wide as with fear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Æetes
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go back to your ship and make ready
          for the trial.”</span> Jason, with Peleus and Telamon, left the
          chamber, and the king smiled grimly as he saw them go. Phrontis and
          Melas went to where their mother was. But Medea stayed, and Æetes
          looked upon her with his great leopard’s eyes. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My daughter, my wise Medea,”</span> he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“go, put spells upon the Moon, that Hecate
          may weaken that man in his hour of trial.”</span> Medea turned away
          from her father’s eyes, and went to her chamber.</p><span class=

          away from her father’s eyes and she went into her own chamber. For
          a long time she stood there with her hands clasped together. She
          heard the voice of Chalciope lamenting because Æetes had taken a
          hatred to her sons and might strive to destroy them. She heard the
          voice of her sister lamenting, but Medea thought that the cause
          that her sister had for grieving was small compared with the cause
          that she herself had.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She thought on
          the moment when she had seen Jason for the first time—in the
          courtyard as the mist lifted and the dove flew to her; she thought
          of him as he lifted those bright eyes of his; then she thought of
          his voice as he spoke after her father had imposed the dreadful
          trial upon him. She would have liked then to have cried out to him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O youth, if others rejoice at the doom
          that you go to, I do not rejoice.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Still her
          sister lamented. But how great was her own grief compared to her
          sister’s! For Chalciope could try to help her sons and could lament
          for the danger they were in and no one would blame her. But she
          might not strive to help Jason nor might she lament for the danger
          he was in. How terrible it would be for a maiden to help a stranger
          against her father’s design! How terrible it would be for a woman
          of Colchis to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span>
          help a stranger against the will of the king! How terrible it would
          be for a daughter to plot against King Æetes in his own palace!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then Medea
          hated Aea, her city. She hated the furious people who came together
          in the assembly, and she hated the brazen bulls that Hephæstus had
          given her father. And then she thought that there was nothing in
          Aea except the furious people and the fire-breathing bulls. O how
          pitiful it was that the strange hero and his friends should have
          come to such a place for the sake of the Golden Fleece that was
          watched over by the sleepless serpent in the grove of Ares!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Still Chalciope
          lamented. Would Chalciope come to her and ask her, Medea, to help
          her sons? If she should come she might speak of the strangers, too,
          and of the danger they were in. Medea went to her couch and lay
          down upon it. She longed for her sister to come to her or to call
          to her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Chalciope
          stayed in her own chamber. Medea, lying upon her couch, listened to
          her sister’s laments. At last she went near where Chalciope was.
          Then shame that she should think so much about the stranger came
          over her. She stood there without moving; she turned to go back to
          the couch, and then trembled so much that she could not stir. As
          she stood between her couch and her sister’s chamber she heard the
          voice of Chalciope calling to her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She went into
          the chamber where her sister stood. Chalciope flung her arms around
          her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Swear,”</span> said she to Medea,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“swear by Hecate, the Moon, that you will never speak
          of something I am going to ask you.”</span> Medea swore that she
          would never speak of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Chalciope spoke
          of the danger her sons were in. She asked Medea to devise a way by
          which they could escape with the stranger from Aea. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In Aea and in Colchis,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there will be no safety for my sons
          henceforth.”</span> And to save Phrontis and Melas, she said, Medea
          would have to save the strangers also. Surely she knew of a charm
          that would save the stranger from the brazen bulls in the contest
          on the morrow!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Chalciope
          came to the very thing that was in Medea’s mind. Her heart bounded
          with joy and she embraced her. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Chalciope,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I declare that I am your sister, indeed—aye, and your
          daughter, too, for did you not care for me when I was an infant? I
          will strive to save your sons. I will strive to save the strangers
          who came with your sons. Send one to the strangers—send him to the
          leader of the strangers, and tell him that I would see him at
          daybreak in the temple of Hecate.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When Medea said
          this Chalciope embraced her again. She was amazed to see how
          Medea’s tears were flowing. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Chalciope,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“no one will know the dangers that I shall go through
          to save them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Swiftly then
          Chalciope went from the chamber. But Medea stayed there with her
          head bowed and the blush of shame on her face. She thought that
          already she had deceived her sister, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page121">[pg 121]</span> making her think that it was Phrontis and
          Melas and not Jason that was in her mind to save. And she thought
          on how she would have to plot against her father and against her
          own people, and all for the sake of a stranger who would sail away
          without thought of her, without the image of her in his mind.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason, with
          Peleus and Telamon, went back to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          His comrades asked how he had fared, and when he spoke to them of
          the fire-breathing bulls with feet of brass, of the dragon’s teeth
          that had to be sown, and of the Earth-born Men that had to be
          overcome, the Argonauts were greatly cast down, for this task, they
          thought, was one that could not be accomplished. He who stood
          before the fire-breathing bulls would perish on the moment. But
          they knew that one amongst them must strive to accomplish the task.
          And if Jason held back, Peleus, Telamon, Theseus, Castor,
          Polydeuces, or any one of the others would undertake it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Jason would
          not hold back. On the morrow, he said, he would strive to yoke the
          fire-breathing, brazen-footed bulls to the plow of adamant. If he
          perished the Argonauts should then do what they thought was
          best—make other trials to gain the Golden Fleece, or turn their
          ship and sail back to Greece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> While they were
          speaking, Phrontis, Chalciope’s son, came to the ship. The
          Argonauts welcomed him, and in a while he began to speak of his
          mother’s sister and of the help she could give. They grew eager as
          he spoke of her, all except rough <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page122">[pg 122]</span> Arcas, who stood wrapped in his bear’s
          skin. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shame on us,”</span> rough Arcas
          cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“shame on us if we have come here to
          crave the help of girls! Speak no more of this! Let us, the
          Argonauts, go with swords into the city of Aea, and slay this king,
          and carry off the Fleece of Gold.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Some of the
          Argonauts murmured approval of what Arcas said. But Orpheus
          silenced him and them, for in his prophetic mind Orpheus saw
          something of the help that Medea would give them. It would be well,
          Orpheus said, to take help from this wise maiden; Jason should go
          to her in the temple of Hecate. The Argonauts agreed to this; they
          listened to what Phrontis told them about the brazen bulls, and the
          night wore on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When darkness
          came upon the earth; when, at sea, sailors looked to the Bear and
          the stars of Orion; when, in the city, there was no longer the
          sound of barking dogs nor of men’s voices, Medea went from the
          palace. She came to a path; she followed it until it brought her
          into the part of the grove that was all black with the shadow that
          oak trees made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She raised up
          her hands and she called upon Hecate, the Moon. As she did, there
          was a blaze as from torches all around, and she saw horrible
          serpents stretching themselves toward her from the branches of the
          trees. Medea shrank back in fear. But again she called upon Hecate.
          And now there was a howling as from the hounds of Hades all around
          her. Fearful, indeed, Medea grew as the howling came near her;
          almost she turned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span> to flee. But she raised her hands again and called upon
          Hecate. Then the nymphs who haunted the marsh and the river
          shrieked, and at those shrieks Medea crouched down in fear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She called upon
          Hecate, the Moon, again. She saw the moon rise above the treetops,
          and then the hissing and shrieking and howling died away. Holding
          up a goblet in her hand Medea poured out a libation of honey to
          Hecate, the Moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then she
          went to where the moon made a brightness upon the ground. There she
          saw a flower that rose above the other flowers—a flower that grew
          from two joined stalks, and that was of the color of a crocus.
          Medea cut the stalks with a brazen knife, and as she did there came
          a deep groan out of the earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> This was the
          Promethean flower. It had come out of the earth first when the
          vulture that tore at Prometheus’s liver had let fall to earth a
          drop of his blood. With a Caspian shell that she had brought with
          her Medea gathered the dark juice of this flower—the juice that
          went to make her most potent charm. All night she went through the
          grove gathering the juice of secret herbs; then she mingled them in
          a phial that she put away in her girdle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She went from
          that grove and along the river. When the sun shed its first rays
          upon snowy Caucasus she stood outside the temple of Hecate. She
          waited, but she had not long to wait, for, like the bright star
          Sirius rising out of Ocean, soon she saw Jason coming toward her.
          She made a sign to him, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
          124]</span> and he came and stood beside her in the portals of the
          temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They would have
          stood face to face if Medea did not have her head bent. A blush had
          come upon her face, and Jason seeing it, and seeing how her head
          was bent, knew how grievous it was to her to meet and speak to a
          stranger in this way. He took her hand and he spoke to her
          reverently, as one would speak to a priestess.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          implore you by Hecate and by Zeus who helps all strangers and
          suppliants to be kind to me and to the men who have come to your
          country with me. Without your help I cannot hope to prevail in the
          grievous trial that has been laid upon me. If you will help us,
          Medea, your name will be renowned throughout all Greece. And I have
          hopes that you will help us, for your face and form show you to be
          one who can be kind and gracious.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The blush of
          shame had gone from Medea’s face and a softer blush came over her
          as Jason spoke. She looked upon him and she knew that she could
          hardly live if the breath of the brazen bulls withered his life or
          if the Earth-born Men slew him. She took the charm from out her
          girdle; ungrudgingly she put it into Jason’s hands. And as she gave
          him the charm that she had gained with such danger, the fear and
          trouble that was around her heart melted as the dew melts from
          around the rose when it is warmed by the first light of the
          morning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then they spoke
          standing close together in the portal of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span> temple. She told him how
          he should anoint his body all over with the charm; it would give
          him, she said, boundless and untiring strength, and make him so
          that the breath of the bulls could not wither him nor the horns of
          the bulls pierce him. She told him also to sprinkle his shield and
          his sword with the charm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then they
          spoke of the dragon’s teeth and of the Earth-born Men who would
          spring from them. Medea told Jason that when they arose out of the
          earth he was to cast a great stone amongst them. The Earth-born Men
          would struggle about the stone, and they would slay each other in
          the contest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Her dark and
          delicate face was beautiful. Jason looked upon her, and it came
          into his mind that in Colchis there was something else of worth
          besides the Golden Fleece. And he thought that after he had won the
          Fleece there would be peace between the Argonauts and King Æetes,
          and that he and Medea might sit together in the king’s hall. But
          when he spoke of being joined in friendship with her father, Medea
          cried:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Think not of treaties nor of covenants. In Greece such
          are regarded, but not here. Ah, do not think that the king, my
          father, will keep any peace with you! When you have won the Fleece
          you must hasten away. You must not tarry in Aea.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She said this
          and her cheeks were wet with tears to think that he should go so
          soon, that he would go so far, and that she would never look upon
          him again. She bent her head again and she said: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tell me about your own land; about the place
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span> of your
          father, the place where you will live when you win back from
          Colchis.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason told
          her of Iolcus; he told her how it was circled by mountains not so
          lofty as her Caucasus; he told her of the pasture lands of Iolcus
          with their flocks of sheep; he told her of the Mountain Pelion
          where he had been reared by Chiron, the ancient centaur; he told
          her of his father who lingered out his life in waiting for his
          return.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When you go back to Iolcus do not forget
          me, Medea. I shall remember you, Jason, even in my father’s
          despite. And it will be my hope that some rumor of you will come to
          me like some messenger-bird. If you forget me may some blast of
          wind sweep me away to Iolcus, and may I sit in your hall an unknown
          and an unexpected guest!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then they
          parted; Medea went swiftly back to the palace, and Jason, turning
          to the river, went to where the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          was moored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The heroes
          embraced and questioned him; he told them of Medea’s counsel and he
          showed them the charm she had given him. That savage man Arcas
          scoffed at Medea’s counsel and Medea’s charm, saying that the
          Argonauts had become poor-spirited indeed when they had to depend
          upon a girl’s help.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason bathed in
          the river; then he anointed himself with the charm; he sprinkled
          his spear and shield and sword with it. He came to Arcas who sat
          upon his bench, still nursing his anger, and he held the spear
          toward him. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Arcas took up
          his heavy sword and he hewed at the butt of the spear. The edge of
          the sword turned. The blade leaped back in his hand as if it had
          been struck against an anvil. And Jason, feeling within him a
          boundless and tireless strength, laughed aloud.</p>

          the ship out of the backwater and they brought her to a wharf in

          Then they marched to the field of Ares, where the king and the
          Colchian people were.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason, carrying
          his shield and spear, went before the king. From the king’s hand he
          took the gleaming helmet that held the dragon’s teeth. This he put
          into the hands of Theseus, who went with him. Then with the spear
          and shield in his hands, with his sword girt across his shoulders,
          and with his mantle stripped off, Jason looked across the field of
          Ares.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He saw the plow
          that he was to yoke to the bulls; he saw the yoke of bronze near
          it; he saw the tracks of the bulls’ hooves. He followed the tracks
          until he came to the lair of the fire-breathing bulls. Out of that
          lair, which was underground, smoke and fire belched. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He set his feet
          firmly upon the ground and he held his shield before him. He
          awaited the onset of the bulls. They came clanging up with loud
          bellowing, breathing out fire. They lowered their heads, and with
          mighty, iron-tipped horns they came to gore and trample him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea’s charm
          had made him strong; Medea’s charm had made his shield impregnable.
          The rush of the bulls did not overthrow him. His comrades shouted
          to see him standing firmly there, and in wonder the Colchians gazed
          upon him. All round him, as from a furnace, there came smoke and
          fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The bulls
          roared mightily. Grasping the horns of the bull that was upon his
          right hand, Jason dragged him until he had brought him beside the
          yoke of bronze. Striking the brazen knees of the bull suddenly with
          his foot he forced him down. Then he smote the other bull as it
          rushed upon him, and it too he forced down upon its knees.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Castor and
          Polydeuces held the yoke to him. Jason bound it upon the necks of
          the bulls. He fastened the plow to the yoke. Then he took his
          shield and set it upon his back, and grasping the handles of the
          plow he started to make the furrow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> With his long
          spear he drove the bulls before him as with a goad. Terribly they
          raged, furiously they breathed out fire. Beside Jason Theseus went
          holding the helmet that held the dragon’s teeth. The hard ground
          was torn up by the plow of adamant, and the clods groaned as they
          were cast up. Jason <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
          129]</span> flung the teeth between the open sods, often turning
          his head in fear that the deadly crop of the Earth-born Men were
          rising behind him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> By the time
          that a third of the day was finished the field of Ares had been
          plowed and sown. As yet the furrows were free of the Earth-born
          Men. Jason went down to the river and filled his helmet full of
          water and drank deeply. And his knees that were stiffened with the
          plowing he bent until they were made supple again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He saw the
          field rising into mounds. It seemed that there were graves all over
          the field of Ares. Then he saw spears and shields and helmets
          rising up out of the earth. Then armed warriors sprang up, a fierce
          battle cry upon their lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason
          remembered the counsel of Medea. He raised a boulder that four men
          could hardly raise and with arms hardened by the plowing he cast
          it. The Colchians shouted to see such a stone cast by the hands of
          one man. Right into the middle of the Earth-born Men the stone
          came. They leaped upon it like hounds, striking at one another as
          they came together. Shield crashed on shield, spear rang upon spear
          as they struck at each other. The Earth-born Men, as fast as they
          arose, went down before the weapons in the hands of their
          brethren.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason rushed
          upon them, his sword in his hand. He slew some that had risen out
          of the earth only as far as the shoulders; he slew others whose
          feet were still in the earth; he slew others who were ready to
          spring upon him. Soon all the Earth-born <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page130">[pg 130]</span> Men were slain, and the furrows ran
          with their dark blood as channels run with water in springtime.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          shouted loudly for Jason’s victory. King Æetes rose from his seat
          that was beside the river and he went back to the city. The
          Colchians followed him. Day faded, and Jason’s contest was
          ended.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But it was not
          the will of Æetes that the strangers should be let depart peaceably
          with the Golden Fleece that Jason had won. In the assembly place,
          with his son Apsyrtus beside him, and with the furious Colchians
          all around him, the king stood: on his breast was the gleaming
          corselet that Ares had given him, and on his head was that golden
          helmet with its four plumes that made him look as if he were truly
          the son of Helios, the Sun. Lightnings flashed from his great eyes;
          he spoke fiercely to the Colchians, holding in his hand his
          bronze-topped spear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He would have
          them attack the strangers and burn the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          He would have the sons of Phrixus slain for bringing them to Aea.
          There was a prophecy, he declared, that would have him be watchful
          of the treachery of his own offspring: this prophecy was being
          fulfilled by the children of Chalciope; he feared, too, that his
          daughter, Medea, had aided the strangers. So the king spoke, and
          the Colchians, hating all strangers, shouted around him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Word of what
          her father had said was brought to Medea. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page131">[pg 131]</span> She knew that she would have to go to
          the Argonauts and bid them flee hastily from Aea. They would not
          go, she knew, without the Golden Fleece; then she, Medea, would
          have to show them how to gain the Fleece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then she could
          never again go back to her father’s palace, she could never again
          sit in this chamber and talk to her handmaidens, and be with
          Chalciope, her sister. Forever afterward she would be dependent on
          the kindness of strangers. Medea wept when she thought of all this.
          And then she cut off a tress of her hair and she left it in her
          chamber as a farewell from one who was going afar. Into the chamber
          where Chalciope was she whispered farewell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The palace
          doors were all heavily bolted, but Medea did not have to pull back
          the bolts. As she chanted her Magic Song the bolts softly drew
          back, the doors softly opened. Swiftly she went along the ways that
          led to the river. She came to where fires were blazing and she knew
          that the Argonauts were there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She called to
          them, and Phrontis, Chalciope’s son, heard the cry and knew the
          voice. To Jason he spoke, and Jason quickly went to where Medea
          stood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She clasped
          Jason’s hand and she drew him with her. <span class=

          Fleece off the oak in the grove of Ares.”</span> When she said
          these words all Jason’s being became taut like the string of a bow.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then the
          hour when huntsmen cast sleep from their eyes—huntsmen who never

          and away with their hounds before the beams of the sun efface the
          track and the scent of the quarry. Along a path that went from the
          river Medea drew Jason. They entered a grove. Then Jason saw
          something that was like a cloud filled with the light of the rising
          sun. It hung from a great oak tree. In awe he stood and looked upon
          it, knowing that at last he looked upon <span class=

          Fleece</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> His hand let
          slip Medea’s hand and he went to seize the Fleece. As he did he
          heard a dreadful hiss. And then he saw the guardian of the Golden

          and sleepless eyes, was a deadly serpent. Its hiss ran all through
          the grove and the birds that were wakening up squawked in
          terror.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Like rings of
          smoke that rise one above the other, the coils of the serpent went
          around the tree—coils covered by hard and gleaming scales. It
          uncoiled, stretched itself, and lifted its head to strike. Then
          Medea dropped on her knees before it, and began to chant her Magic
          Song.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As she sang,
          the coils around the tree grew slack. Like a dark, noiseless wave
          the serpent sank down on the ground. But still its jaws were open,
          and those dreadful jaws threatened Jason. Medea, with a newly cut
          spray of juniper dipped in a mystic brew, touched its deadly eyes.
          And still she chanted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg
          133]</span> her Magic Song. The serpent’s jaws closed; its eyes
          became deadened; far through the grove its length was stretched
          out.</p>

          the Golden Fleece. As he raised his hands to it, its brightness was
          such as to make a flame on his face. Medea called to him. He strove
          to gather it all up in his arms; Medea was beside him, and they
          went swiftly on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They came to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now as they
          went down the river they saw that dangers were coming swiftly upon

          King Æetes in his chariot, a blazing torch lighting his corselet
          and his helmet. Swiftly the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          behind her, and they went swiftly too.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They came into
          the Sea of Pontus, and Phrontis, the son of Phrixus, gave counsel

          close to your land.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          thought well of what Phrontis said; into the waters of the Ister
          the ship was brought. Many of the Colchian ships passed by the
          mouth of the river, and went seeking the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          toward the passage of the Symplegades.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the
          Argonauts were on a way that was dangerous for them. For Apsyrtus
          had not gone toward the Symplegades <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page135">[pg 135]</span> seeking the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          He had led his soldiers overland to the River Ister at a place that
          was at a distance above its mouth. There were islands in the river
          at that place, and the soldiers of Apsyrtus landed on the islands,
          while Apsyrtus went to the kings of the people around and claimed
          their support.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          came and the heroes found themselves cut off. They could not make
          their way between the islands that were filled with the Colchian
          soldiers, nor along the banks that were lined with men friendly to
          King Æetes. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> was stayed. Apsyrtus sent for
          the chiefs; he had men enough to overwhelm them, but he shrank from
          a fight with the heroes, and he thought that he might gain all he
          wanted from them without a struggle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus and
          Peleus went to him. Apsyrtus would have them give up the Golden
          Fleece; he would have them give up Medea and the sons of Phrixus
          also.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus and
          Peleus appealed to the judgment of the kings who supported
          Apsyrtus. Æetes, they said, had no more claim on the Golden Fleece.
          He had promised it to Jason as a reward for tasks that he had
          imposed. The tasks had been accomplished and the Fleece, no matter
          in what way it was taken from the grove of Ares, was theirs. So
          Theseus and Peleus said, and the kings who supported Apsyrtus gave
          judgment for the Argonauts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Medea would
          have to be given to her brother. If that were done the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          would be let go on her course, Apsyrtus said, and the Golden Fleece
          would be left with them. Apsyrtus said, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page136">[pg 136]</span> too, that he would not take Medea back
          to the wrath of her father; if the Argonauts gave her up she would
          be let stay on the island of Artemis and under the guardianship of
          the goddess.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The chiefs
          brought Apsyrtus’s words back. There was a council of the
          Argonauts, and they agreed that they should leave Medea on the
          island of Artemis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But grief and
          wrath took hold of Medea when she heard of this resolve. Almost she
          would burn the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>. She went to where Jason
          stood, and she spoke again of all she had done to save his life and
          win the Golden Fleece for the Argonauts. Jason made her look on the
          ships and the soldiers that were around them; he showed her how
          these could overwhelm the Argonauts and slay them all. With all the
          heroes slain, he said, Medea would come into the hands of Apsyrtus,
          who then could leave her on the island of Artemis or take her back
          to the wrath of her father.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Medea would
          not consent to go nor could Jason’s heart consent to let her go.
          Then these two made a plot to deceive Apsyrtus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have not been of the council that agreed to give you
          up to him,”</span> Jason said. <span class="tei tei-q">“After you
          have been left there I will take you off the island of Artemis
          secretly. The Colchians and the kings who support them, not knowing
          that you have been taken off and hidden on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>,
          will let us pass.”</span> This Medea and Jason planned to do, and
          it was an ill thing, for it <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page137">[pg 137]</span> was breaking the covenant that the chiefs
          had entered with Apsyrtus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea then was
          left by the Argonauts on the island of Artemis. Now Apsyrtus had
          been commanded by his father to bring her back to Aea; he thought
          that when she had been left by the Argonauts he could force her to
          come with him. So he went over to the island. Jason, secretly
          leaving his companions, went to the island from the other side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Before the
          temple of Artemis Jason and Apsyrtus came face to face. Both men,
          thinking they had been betrayed to their deaths, drew their swords.
          Then, before the vestibule of the temple and under the eyes of
          Medea, Jason and Apsyrtus fought. Jason’s sword pierced the son of
          Æetes; as he fell Apsyrtus cried out bitter words against Medea,
          saying that it was on her account that he had come on his death.
          And as he fell the blood of her brother splashed Medea’s silver
          veil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Jason lifted
          Medea up and carried her to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          They hid the maiden under the Fleece of Gold and they sailed past
          the ships of the Colchians. When darkness came they were far from
          the island of Artemis. It was then that they heard a loud wailing,
          and they knew that the Colchians had discovered that their prince
          had been slain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Colchians
          did not pursue them. Fearing the wrath of Æetes they made
          settlements in the lands of the kings who had supported Apsyrtus;
          they never went back to Aea; they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page138">[pg 138]</span> called themselves Apsyrtians
          henceforward, naming themselves after the prince they had come
          with.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They had
          escaped the danger that had hemmed them in, but the Argonauts, as
          they sailed on, were not content; covenants had been broken, and
          blood had been shed in a bad cause. And as they went on through the
          darkness the voice of the ship was heard; at the sound of that
          voice fear and sorrow came upon the voyagers, for they felt that it
          had a prophecy of doom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Castor and
          Polydeuces went to the front of the ship; holding up their hands,
          they prayed. Then they heard the words that the voice uttered: in
          the night as they went on the voice proclaimed the wrath of Zeus on
          account of the slaying of Apsyrtus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> What was their
          doom to be? It was that the Argonauts would have to wander forever
          over the gulfs of the sea unless Medea had herself cleansed of her

          daughter of Helios and Perse. The voice urged the heroes to pray to
          the immortal gods that the way to the island of Circe be shown to

          the Stormy Lakes. A mist lay upon the lakes night and day; voyaging
          through them the Argonauts at last brought out their ship upon the
          Sea of Ausonia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was Zetes

          safely along this dangerous course. And to Zetes and Calais Iris,

          was all around that island, and on its height a marble house was to

          dragonflies; they came down to the shore, and then the heroes saw
          that they were maidens in gleaming dresses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The maidens
          waved their hands to the voyagers, calling them to come on the

          Medea cried out to them. She showed them the beasts that whimpered
          around the maidens, and then, as the Argonauts looked upon them,
          they saw that these were not beasts of the wild. There was
          something strange and fearful about them; the heroes gazed upon
          them with troubled eyes. They brought the ship near, but they
          stayed upon their benches, holding the oars in their hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea sprang to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When Medea took
          her hands away from before her face, Circe knew that, like herself,
          this maiden was of the race of Helios. Medea spoke to her, telling
          her first of the voyage of the heroes and of their toils; telling
          her then of how she had given help to Jason against the will of
          Æetes, her father; telling her then, fearfully, of the slaying of
          Apsyrtus. She covered her face with her robe as she spoke of it.
          And then she told Circe she had come, warned by the judgment of
          Zeus, to ask of Circe, the daughter of Helios, to purify her from
          the stain of her brother’s blood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Like all the
          children of Helios, Circe had eyes that were wide and full of life,
          but she had stony lips—lips that were heavy and moveless. Bright
          golden hair hung smoothly along each of her sides. First she held a
          cup to them that was filled with pure water, and Jason and Medea
          drank from that cup.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Circe
          stayed by the hearth; she burnt cakes in the flame, and all the
          while she prayed to Zeus to be gentle with these suppliants. She
          brought both to the seashore. There she washed Medea’s body and her
          garments with the spray of the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea pleaded
          with Circe to tell her of the life she foresaw for her, but Circe
          would not speak of it. She told Medea that one day she would meet a
          woman who knew nothing about enchantments but who had much human
          wisdom. She was to ask of her what she was to do in her life or
          what she was to leave undone. And whatever this woman out of her
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span> wisdom told
          her, that Medea was to regard. Once more Circe offered them the cup
          filled with clear water, and when they had drunken of it she left
          them upon the seashore. As she went toward her marble house the
          strange beasts followed Circe, whimpering as they went. Jason and
          Medea went aboard the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          the heroes now. They would have fain gone upon the island of Circe
          to rest there away from the oars and the sound of the sea. But the
          wisest of them, looking upon the beasts that were men transformed,
          held the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> far off the shore. Then Jason
          and Medea came aboard, and with heavy hearts and wearied arms they
          turned to the open sea again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> No longer had
          they such high hearts as when they drove the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          between the Clashers and into the Sea of Pontus. Now their heads
          drooped as they went on, and they sang such songs as slaves sing in
          their hopeless labor. Orpheus grew fearful for them now.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> For Orpheus
          knew that they were drawing toward a danger. There was no other way
          for them, he knew, but past the Island Anthemœssa in the Tyrrhenian
          Sea where the Sirens were. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page143">[pg 143]</span> Once they had been nymphs and had tended
          Persephone before she was carried off by Aidoneus to be his queen
          in the Underworld. Kind they had been, but now they were changed,
          and they cared only for the destruction of men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All set around
          with rocks was the island where they were. As the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          came near, the Sirens, ever on the watch to draw mariners to their
          destruction, saw them and came to the rocks and sang to them,
          holding each other’s hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They sang all
          together their lulling song. That song made the wearied voyagers
          long to let their oars go with the waves, and drift, drift to where
          the Sirens were. Bending down to them the Sirens, with soft hands
          and white arms, would lift them to soft resting places. Then each
          of the Sirens sang a clear, piercing song that called to each of
          the voyagers. Each man thought that his own name was in that song.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O how well it is that you have come
          near,”</span> each one sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“how well it
          is that you have come near where I have awaited you, having all
          delight prepared for you!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Orpheus took up
          his lyre as the Sirens began to sing. He sang to the heroes of
          their own toils. He sang of them, how, gaunt and weary as they
          were, they were yet men, men who were the strength of Greece, men
          who had been fostered by the love and hope of their country. They
          were the winners of the Golden Fleece and their story would be told
          forever. And for the fame that they had won men would forego all
          rest and all delight. Why should they not toil, they who were born
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span> for great
          labors and to face dangers that other men might not face? Soon
          hands would be stretched out to them—the welcoming hands of the men
          and women of their own land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Orpheus
          sang, and his voice and the music of his lyre prevailed above the
          Sirens’ voices. Men dropped their oars, but other men remained at
          their benches, and pulled steadily, if wearily, on. Only one of the
          Argonauts, Butes, a youth of Iolcus, threw himself into the water
          and swam toward the rocks from which the Sirens sang.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But an anguish
          that nearly parted their spirits from their bodies was upon them as
          they went wearily on. Toward the end of the day they beheld another
          island—an island that seemed very fair; they longed to land and
          rest themselves there and eat the fruits of the island. But Orpheus
          would not have them land. The island, he said, was Thrinacia. Upon
          that island the Cattle of the Sun pastured, and if one of the
          cattle perished through them their return home might not be won.
          They heard the lowing of the cattle through the mist, and a deep
          longing for the sight of their own fields, with a white house near,
          and flocks and herds at pasture, came over the heroes. They came
          near the Island of Thrinacia, and they saw the Cattle of the Sun
          feeding by the meadow streams; not one of them was black; all were
          white as milk, and the horns upon their heads were golden. They saw
          the two nymphs who herded the kine—Phæthusa and Lampetia, one with
          a staff of silver and the other with a staff of gold. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Driven by the
          breeze that came over the Thrinacian Sea the Argonauts came to the
          land of the Phæacians. It was a good land as they saw when they
          drew near; a land of orchards and fresh pastures, with a white and
          sun-lit city upon the height. Their spirits came back to them as
          they drew into the harbor; they made fast the hawsers, and they
          went upon the ways of the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then they
          saw everywhere around them the dark faces of Colchian soldiers.
          These were the men of King Æetes, and they had come overland to the
          Phæacian city, hoping to cut off the Argonauts. Jason, when he saw
          the soldiers, shouted to those who had been left on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>,
          and they drew out of the harbor, fearful lest the Colchians should
          grapple with the ship and wrest from them the Fleece of Gold. Then
          Jason made an encampment upon the shore, and the captain of the
          Colchians went here and there, gathering together his men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea left
          Jason’s side and hastened through the city. To the palace of
          Alcinous, king of the Phæacians, she went. Within the palace she
          found Arete, the queen. And Arete was sitting by her hearth,
          spinning golden and silver threads.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Arete was young
          at that time, as young as Medea, and as yet no child had been born
          to her. But she had the clear eyes of one who understands, and who
          knows how to order things well. Stately, too, was Arete, for she
          had been reared in the house of a great king. Medea came to her,
          and fell upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span>
          her knees before her, and told her how she had fled from the house
          of her father, King Æetes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She told Arete,
          too, how she had helped Jason to win the Golden Fleece, and she
          told her how through her her brother had been led to his death. As
          she told this part of her story she wept and prayed at the knees of
          the queen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Arete was
          greatly moved by Medea’s tears and prayers. She went to Alcinous in
          his garden, and she begged of him to save the Argonauts from the
          great force of the Colchians that had come to cut them off.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Golden Fleece,”</span> said Arete,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“has been won by the tasks that Jason
          performed. If the Colchians should take Medea, it would be to bring
          her back to Aea and to a bitter doom. And the maiden,”</span> said
          the queen, <span class="tei tei-q">“has broken my heart by her
          prayers and tears.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Alcinous
          said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Æetes is strong, and although his
          kingdom is far from ours, he can bring war upon us.”</span> But
          still Arete pleaded with him to protect Medea from the Colchians.
          Alcinous went within; he raised up Medea from where she crouched on
          the floor of the palace, and he promised her that the Argonauts
          would be protected in his city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the king
          mounted his chariot; Medea went with him, and they came down to the
          seashore where the heroes had made their encampment. The Argonauts
          and the Colchians were drawn up against each other, and the
          Colchians far outnumbered the wearied heroes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Alcinous drove
          his chariot between the two armies. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page147">[pg 147]</span> Colchians prayed him to have the
          strangers make surrender to them. But the king drove his chariot to
          where the heroes stood, and he took the hand of each, and received
          them as his guests. Then the Colchians knew that they might not
          make war upon the heroes. They drew off. The next day they marched
          away.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was a rich
          land that they had come to. Once Aristæus dwelt there, the king who
          discovered how to make bees store up their honey for men and how to
          make the good olive grow. Macris, his daughter, tended Dionysus,
          the son of Zeus, when Hermes brought him of the flame, and
          moistened his lips with honey. She tended him in a cave in the
          Phæacian land, and ever afterward the Phæacians were blessed with
          all good things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now as the
          heroes marched to the palace of King Alcinous the people came to
          meet them, bringing them sheep and calves and jars of wine and
          honey. The women brought them fresh garments; to Medea they gave
          fine linen and golden ornaments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Amongst the
          Phæacians who loved music and games and the telling of stories the

          for the seven days that they stayed amongst them, the Phæacians
          brought rich presents to the heroes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Medea,
          looking into the clear eyes of Queen Arete, knew <span class=

          whom Circe had prophesied, the woman who knew nothing of
          enchantments, but who had much human wisdom. She was to ask of her
          what she was to do in her life and what she was to leave undone.
          And what this woman told her Medea was to regard. Arete told her
          that she was to forget all the witcheries and enchantments that she
          knew, and that she was never to practice against the life of any
          one. This she told Medea upon the shore, before Jason lifted her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The blast drove

          such as might not come again for long left the Argonauts on the

          came over each of them. No spring of water could they descry; no
          path; no herdsman’s cabin; over all that vast land there was
          silence and dead calm. And one said to the other: <span class=

          the tempest had overwhelmed us, or would that we had lost the ship

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And the

          back toward the sea, leaving only foam on which no ship can sail to

          beside the ship, so troubled that his life nearly went from him. He
          saw Medea huddled against a rock and with her hair streaming on the
          sand. He saw the men who, with all the bravery of their lives, had
          come with him, stretched on the desert sand, weary and without
          hope. He thought that they, the best of men, might die in this
          desert with their deeds all unknown; he thought that he might never
          win home with Medea, to make her his queen in Iolcus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He lay against
          the side of the ship, his cloak wrapped around his head. And there
          death would have come to him and to the others if the nymphs of the
          desert had been unmindful of these brave men. They came to Jason.
          It was midday then, and the fierce rays of the sun were scorching
          all Libya. They drew off the cloak that wrapped his head; they
          stood near him, three nymphs girded around with goatskins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why art thou so smitten with despair?”</span> the
          nymphs said to Jason. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why art thou smitten
          with despair, thou who hast wrought so much and hast won so much?
          Up! Arouse thy comrades! We are the solitary nymphs, the warders of
          the land of Libya, and we have come to show a way of escape to you,
          the Argonauts.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Look around and watch for the time when Poseidon’s
          great horse shall be unloosed. Then make ready to pay recompense to
          the mother that bore you all. What she did for you all, that you
          all must do for her; by doing it you will win back to the land of
          Greece.”</span> Jason heard them say these words and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span> then he saw them no more;
          the nymphs vanished amongst the desert mounds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason rose
          up. He did not know what to make out of what had been told him, but
          there was courage now and hope in his heart. He shouted; his voice
          was like the roar of a lion calling to his mate. At his shout his
          comrades roused themselves; all squalid with the dust of the desert
          the Argonauts stood around him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Listen, comrades, to me,”</span> Jason said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“while I speak of a strange thing that has
          befallen me. While I lay by the side of our ship three nymphs came
          before me. With light hands they drew away the cloak that wrapped
          my head. They declared themselves to be the solitary nymphs, the
          warders, of Libya. Very strange were the words they said to me.
          When Poseidon’s great horse shall be unloosed, they said, we were
          to make the mother of us all a recompense, doing for her what she
          had done for us all. This the nymphs told me to say, but I cannot
          understand the meaning of their words.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There were some
          there who would not have given heed to Jason’s words, deeming them
          words without meaning. But even as he spoke a wonder came before
          their eyes. Out of the far-off sea a great horse leaped. Vast he
          was of size and he had a golden mane. He shook the spray of the sea
          off his sides and mane. Past them he trampled and away toward the
          horizon, leaving great tracks in the sand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Nestor
          spoke rejoicingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the great horse!
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span> It is the
          horse that the desert nymphs spoke of, Poseidon’s horse. Even now
          has the horse been unloosed, and now is the time to do what the
          nymphs bade us do.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> is the mother of us all? She
          has carried us. Now we must make her a recompense and carry her
          even as she carried us. With untiring shoulders we must bear
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          desert.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

          sea!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Nestor said
          and the Argonauts saw truth in his saying. Hope came to them
          again—the hope of leaving that desert and coming to the sea. Surely
          when they came to the sea again, and spread the sail and held the
          oars in their hands, their sacred ship would make swift course to
          their native land!</p>

          land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A day came when
          they saw the great tracks of the horse <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          covered them with sand. With the mighty weight of the ship upon
          their shoulders, with the sun beating upon their heads, and with no
          marks on the desert to guide them, the heroes stood there, and it
          seemed to them that the blood must gush up and out of their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Zetes and
          Calais, sons of the North Wind, rose up upon their wings to strive
          to get sight of the sea. Up, up, they soared. And then as a man
          sees, or thinks he sees, at the month’s beginning, the moon through
          a bank of clouds, Zetes and Calais, looking over the measureless
          land, saw the gleam of water. They shouted to the Argonauts; they
          marked the way for them, and wearily, but with good hearts, the
          heroes went upon the way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They came at
          last to the shore of what seemed to be a wide inland sea. They set
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> down from off their
          over-wearied shoulders and they let her keel take water once
          more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All salt and
          brackish was that water; they dipped their hands into and tasted
          the salt. Orpheus was able to name the water they had come to; it
          was that lake that was called after Triton, the son of Nereus, the
          ancient one of the sea. They set up an altar and they made
          sacrifices in thanksgiving to the gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They had come
          to water at last, but now they had to seek for other water—for the
          sweet water that they could drink. All around them they looked, but
          they saw no sign of a spring. And then they felt a wind blow upon
          them—a wind that had in it not the dust of the desert but the
          fragrance of growing things. Toward where that wind blew from they
          went. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As they went on
          they saw a great shape against the sky; they saw mountainous
          shoulders bowed. Orpheus bade them halt and turn their faces with
          reverence toward that great shape: for this was Atlas the Titan,
          the brother of Prometheus, who stood there to hold up the sky on
          his shoulders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then they were
          near the place that the fragrance had blown from: there was a
          garden there; the only fence that ran around it was a lattice of
          silver. <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely there are springs in the
          garden,”</span> the Argonauts said. <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          will enter this fair garden now and slake our thirst.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Orpheus bade
          them walk reverently, for all around them, he said, was sacred
          ground. This garden was the Garden of the Hesperides that was
          watched over by the Daughters of the Evening Land. The Argonauts
          looked through the silver lattice; they saw trees with lovely
          fruit, and they saw three maidens moving through the garden with
          watchful eyes. In this garden grew the tree that had the golden
          apples that Zeus gave to Hera as a wedding gift.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They saw the
          tree on which the golden apples grew. The maidens went to it and
          then looked watchfully all around them. They saw the faces of the
          Argonauts looking through the silver lattice and they cried out,
          one to the other, and they joined their hands around the tree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Orpheus
          called to them, and the maidens understood the divine speech of
          Orpheus. He made the Daughters of the Evening Land know that they
          who stood before the lattice were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page155">[pg 155]</span> men who reverenced the gods, who would
          not strive to enter the forbidden garden. The maidens came toward
          them. Beautiful as the singing of Orpheus was their utterance, but
          what they said was a complaint and a lament.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Their lament
          was for the dragon Ladon, that dragon with a hundred heads that
          guarded sleeplessly the tree that had the golden apples. Now that
          dragon was slain. With arrows that had been dipped in the poison of
          the Hydra’s blood their dragon, Ladon, had been slain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Daughters
          of the Evening Land sang of how a mortal had come into the garden
          that they watched over. He had a great bow, and with his arrow he
          slew the dragon that guarded the golden apples. The golden apples
          he had taken away; they had come back to the tree they had been
          plucked from, for no mortal might keep them in his possession. So
          the maidens sang—Hespere, Eretheis, and Ægle—and they complained
          that now, unhelped by the hundred-headed dragon, they had to keep
          guard over the tree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          knew of whom they told the tale—Heracles, their comrade. Would that
          Heracles were with them now!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Hesperides
          told them of Heracles—of how the springs in the garden dried up
          because of his plucking the golden apples. He came out of the
          garden thirsting. Nowhere could he find a spring of water. To
          yonder great rock he went. He smote it with his foot and water came
          out in full flow. Then he, leaning on his hands and with his chest
          upon the ground, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
          156]</span> drank and drank from the water that flowed from the
          rifted rock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          looked to where the rock stood. They caught the sound of water.
          They carried Medea over. And then, company after company, all
          huddled together, they stooped down and drank their fill of the
          clear good water. With lips wet with the water they cried to each
          other, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heracles! Although he is not with
          us, in very truth Heracles has saved his comrades from deadly
          thirst!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They saw his
          footsteps printed upon the rocks, and they followed them until they
          led to the sand where no footsteps stay. Heracles! How glad his
          comrades would have been if they could have had sight of him then!
          But it was long ago—before he had sailed with them—that Heracles
          had been here.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Still hearing
          their complaint they turned back to the lattice, to where the
          Daughters of the Evening Land stood. The Daughters of the Evening
          Land bent their heads to listen to what the Argonauts told one
          another, and, seeing them bent to listen, Orpheus told a story
          about one who had gone across the Libyan desert, about one who was
          a hero like unto Heracles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Beyond where
            Atlas stands there is a cave where the strange women, the ancient
            daughters of Phorcys, live. They have been gray from their birth.
            They have but one eye and one <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page157">[pg 157]</span> tooth between them, and they pass the
            eye and the tooth, one to the other, when they would see or eat.
            They are called the Graiai, these two sisters.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Up to the
            cave where they lived a youth once came. He was beardless, and
            the garb he wore was torn and travel-stained, but he had
            shapeliness and beauty. In his leathern belt there was an
            exceedingly bright sword; this sword was not straight like the
            swords we carry, but it was hooked like a sickle. The strange
            youth with the bright, strange sword came very quickly and very
            silently up to the cave where the Graiai lived and looked over a
            high boulder into it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One was
            sitting munching acorns with the single tooth. The other had the
            eye in her hand. She was holding it to her forehead and looking
            into the back of the cave. These two ancient women, with their
            gray hair falling over them like thick fleeces, and with faces
            that were only forehead and cheeks and nose and mouth, were
            strange creatures truly. Very silently the youth stood looking at
            them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=

            this way. I heard the stir of something.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The other
            turned, and with the eye placed against her forehead looked out
            to the opening of the cave. The youth drew back behind the
            boulder. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sister, sister, there is
            nothing there,”</span> said the one with the eye.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then she
            said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sister, give me the tooth for I

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The one who
            was eating held out the tooth, and the one who was watching held
            out the eye. The youth darted into the cave. Standing between the

            other the eye.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then they

            skinny hands in his strong hands until they should tell him where
            the nymphs dwelt who guarded the magic treasures. The Gray Ones
            told him. Then the youth with the bright sword left the cave. As

            hidden valley. She turned away from him. But she looked again and
            she saw that he was beautiful and brave looking. He had spoken of
            his death. The nymph stood looking at him pitifully, and the
            youth, with the bronze shield laid beside his knees and the

            happy minding his sheep upon the hillside, and he was happy in

            the will and the power to be deadly to him. One day I heard him
            say before his princes and his lords that he would wed, and would
            wed one who was not Danaë. I was overjoyed to hear him say this.

            through the air, taking a way that the nymphs had shown him. He
            came to Oceanus that was the rim around the world. He saw forms
            that were of living creatures all in stone, and he knew that he
            was near the place where the Gorgons had their lair.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, looking
            upon the surface of his polished shield, he saw the Gorgons below
            him. Two were covered with hard serpent scales; they had tusks
            that were long and were like the tusks of boars, and they had
            hands of gleaming brass and wings of shining gold. Still looking
            upon the shining surface of his shield Perseus went down and
            down. He saw the third sister—she who was not immortal. She had a
            woman’s face and form, and her countenance was beautiful,
            although there was something deadly in its fairness. The two
            scaled and winged sisters were asleep, but the third, Medusa, was
            awake, and she was tearing with her hands a lizard that had come
            near her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Upon her head
            was a tangle of serpents all with heads raised as though they
            were hissing. Still looking into the mirror of <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span> his shield Perseus came
            down and over Medusa. He turned his head away from her. Then,
            with a sweep of the sickle-sword he took her head off. There was
            no scream from the Gorgon, but the serpents upon her head hissed
            loudly.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Still with
            his face turned from it he lifted up the head by its tangle of
            serpents. He put it into the magic pouch. He rose up in the air.
            But now the Gorgon sisters were awake. They had heard the hiss of
            Medusa’s serpents, and now they looked upon her headless body.
            They rose up on their golden wings, and their brazen hands were
            stretched out to tear the one who had slain Medusa. As they flew
            after him they screamed aloud.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Although he
            flew like the wind the Gorgon sisters would have overtaken him if
            he had been plain to their eyes. But the dogskin cap of Hades
            saved him, for the Gorgon sisters did not know whether he was
            above or below them, behind or before them. On Perseus went,
            flying toward where Atlas stood. He flew over this place, over
            Libya. Drops of blood from Medusa’s head fell down upon the
            desert. They were changed and became the deadly serpents that are
            on these sands and around these rocks. On and on Perseus flew
            toward Atlas and toward the hidden valley where the nymphs who
            were again to guard the magic treasures had their dwelling place.
            But before he came to the nymphs Perseus had another
            adventure.</p>

            <div class="tei tei-tb">
              &nbsp;
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In Ethopia,
            which is at the other side of Libya, there ruled a <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span> king whose name was
            Cepheus. This king had permitted his queen to boast that she was
            more beautiful than the nymphs of the sea. In punishment for the
            queen’s impiety and for the king’s folly Poseidon sent a monster
            out of the sea to waste that country. Every year the monster
            came, destroying more and more of the country of Ethopia. Then
            the king asked of an oracle what he should do to save his land
            and his people. The oracle spoke of a dreadful thing that he
            would have to do—he would have to sacrifice his daughter, the
            beautiful Princess Andromeda.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king was
            forced by his savage people to take the maiden Andromeda and
            chain her to a rock on the seashore, leaving her there for the
            monster to devour her, satisfying himself with that prey.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Perseus,
            flying near, heard the maiden’s laments. He saw her lovely body
            bound with chains to the rock. He came near her, taking the cap
            of darkness off his head. She saw him, and she bent her head in
            shame, for she thought that he would think that it was for some
            dreadful fault of her own that she had been left chained in that
            place.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Her father
            had stayed near. Perseus saw him, and called to him, and bade him
            tell why the maiden was chained to the rock. The king told
            Perseus of the sacrifice that he had been forced to make. Then
            Perseus came near the maiden, and he saw how she looked at him
            with pleading eyes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Perseus
            made her father promise that he would give <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span> Andromeda to him for
            his wife if he should slay the sea monster. Gladly Cepheus
            promised this. Then Perseus once again drew his sickle-sword; by
            the rock to which Andromeda was still chained he waited for sight
            of the sea monster.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It came
            rolling in from the open sea, a shapeless and unsightly thing.
            With the shoes of flight upon his feet Perseus rose above it. The
            monster saw his shadow upon the water, and savagely it went to
            attack the shadow. Perseus swooped down as an eagle swoops down;
            with his sickle-sword he attacked it, and he struck the hook
            through the monster’s shoulder. Terribly it reared up from the
            sea. Perseus rose over it, escaping its wide-opened mouth with
            its treble rows of fangs. Again he swooped and struck at it. Its
            hide was covered all over with hard scales and with the shells of
            sea things, but Perseus’s sword struck through it. It reared up
            again, spouting water mixed with blood. On a rock near the rock
            that Andromeda was chained to Perseus alighted. The monster,
            seeing him, bellowed and rushed swiftly through the water to
            overwhelm him. As it reared up he plunged the sword again and
            again into its body. Down into the water the monster sank, and
            water mixed with blood was spouted up from the depths into which
            it sank.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then was
            Andromeda loosed from her chains. Perseus, the conqueror, lifted
            up the fainting maiden and carried her back to the king’s palace.
            And Cepheus there renewed his promise to give her in marriage to
            her deliverer.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Perseus went
            on his way. He came to the hidden valley <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page170">[pg 170]</span> where the nymphs had their dwelling
            place, and he restored to them the three magic treasures that
            they had given him—the cap of darkness, the shoes of flight, and
            the magic pouch. And these treasures are still there, and the
            hero who can win his way to the nymphs may have them as Perseus
            had them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Again he
            returned to the place where he had found Andromeda chained. With
            face averted he drew forth the Gorgon’s head from where he had
            hidden it between the rocks. He made a bag for it out of the
            horny skin of the monster he had slain. Then, carrying his
            tremendous trophy, he went to the palace of King Cepheus to claim
            his bride.</p>

            <div class="tei tei-tb">
              &nbsp;
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now before
            her father had thought of sacrificing her to the sea monster he
            had offered Andromeda in marriage to a prince of Ethopia—to a
            prince whose name was Phineus. Phineus did not strive to save
            Andromeda. But, hearing that she had been delivered from the
            monster, he came to take her for his wife; he came to Cepheus’s
            palace, and he brought with him a thousand armed men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The palace of
            Cepheus was filled with armed men when Perseus entered it. He saw
            Andromeda on a raised place in the hall. She was pale as when she
            was chained to the rock, and when she saw him in the palace she
            uttered a cry of gladness.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Cepheus, the
            craven king, would have let him who had come with the armed bands
            take the maiden. Perseus came beside <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page171">[pg 171]</span> Andromeda and he made his claim.
            Phineus spoke insolently to him, and then he urged one of his
            captains to strike Perseus down. Many sprang forward to attack
            him. Out of the bag Perseus drew Medusa’s head. He held it before
            those who were bringing strife into the hall. They were turned to
            stone. One of Cepheus’s men wished to defend Perseus: he struck
            at the captain who had come near; his sword made a clanging sound
            as it struck this one who had looked upon Medusa’s head.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Perseus went
            from the land of Ethopia taking fair Andromeda with him. They
            went into Greece, for he had thought of going to Argos, to the
            country that his grandfather ruled over. At this very time
            Acrisius got tidings of Danaë and her son, and he knew that they
            had not perished on the waves of the sea. Fearful of the prophecy
            that told he would be slain by his grandson and fearing that he
            would come to Argos to seek him, Acrisius fled out of his
            country.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He came into
            Thessaly. Perseus and Andromeda were there. Now, one day the old
            king was brought to games that were being celebrated in honor of
            a dead hero. He was leaning on his staff, watching a youth throw
            a metal disk, when something in that youth’s appearance made him
            want to watch him more closely. About him there was something of
            a being of the upper air; it made Acrisius think of a brazen
            tower and of a daughter whom he had shut up there.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He moved so
            that he might come nearer to the disk-thrower. But as he left
            where he had been standing he came into the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span> line of the thrown
            disk. It struck the old man on the temple. He fell down dead, and
            as he fell the people cried out his name—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Acrisius, King Acrisius!”</span> Then Perseus knew
            whom the disk, thrown by his hand, had slain.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And because
            he had slain the king by chance Perseus would not go to Argos,
            nor take over the kingdom that his grandfather had reigned over.
            With Andromeda he went to Seriphus where his mother was. And in
            Seriphus there still reigned Polydectes, who had put upon him the
            terrible task of winning the Gorgon’s head.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He came to
            Seriphus and he left Andromeda in the hut of Dictys the shepherd.
            No one knew him; he heard his name spoken of as that of a youth
            who had gone on a foolish quest and who would never again be
            heard of. To the temple where his mother was a priestess he came.
            Guards were placed all around it. He heard his mother’s voice and
            it was raised in lament: <span class="tei tei-q">“Walled up here
            and given over to hunger I shall be made go to Polydectes’s house
            and become his wife. O ye gods, have ye no pity for Danaë, the
            mother of Perseus?”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Perseus cried
            aloud, and his mother heard his voice and her moans ceased. He
            turned around and he went to the palace of Polydectes, the
            king.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king
            received him with mockeries. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will let

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Polydectes
            said, and the lords and princes who were around him mocked at

            was a dread thing—the bag made from the hide of the sea monster
            that had in it the Gorgon’s head.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He saw his

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But not with
            empty hands did Perseus step forward. He shouted out:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have brought something to you at last,

            mother, and you, O my friends, avert your faces from what I have
            brought.”</span> Saying this Perseus drew out the Gorgon’s head.
            Holding it by the snaky locks he stood before the company. His
            mother and his friends averted their faces. But Polydectes and
            his insolent friends looked full upon what Perseus showed.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This youth would strive to frighten us
            with some conjuror’s trick,”</span> they said. They said no more,
            for they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span>
            became as stones, and as stone images they still stand in that
            hall in Seriphus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He went to
            the shepherd’s hut, and he brought Dictys from it with Andromeda.
            Dictys he made king in Polydectes’s stead. Then with Danaë and
            Andromeda, his mother and his wife, he went from Seriphus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He did not go

            that of Argos, and there he lived with Andromeda, his lovely wife
            out of Ethopia. They had a son named Perses who became the parent

            head up and bit his foot. They raised him on their shoulders and
            they hurried back with him. But his limbs became numb, and when
            they laid him down on the shore of the lake he stayed moveless.
            Soon he grew cold. They dug a grave for Nauplius beside the lake,
            and in that desert land they set up his helmsman’s oar in the
            middle of his tomb of heaped stones.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now like
            a snake that goes writhing this way and that way and that cannot

            went hither and thither striving to find an outlet from that
            lake. No outlet could they find and the way of their homegoing
            seemed lost to them again. Then Orpheus prayed to the son of
            Nereus, to Triton, whose name was on that lake, to aid them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Triton
            appeared. He stretched out his hand and showed them the outlet to
            the sea. And Triton spoke in friendly wise to the heroes, bidding
            them go upon their way in joy. <span class="tei tei-q">“And as
            for labor,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“let there be
            no grieving because of that, for limbs that have youthful vigor
            should still toil.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They took up
            the oars and they pulled toward the sea, and Triton, the friendly
            immortal, helped them on. He laid hold upon <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Argo’s</span></em> keel and he guided her
            through the water. The Argonauts saw him beneath the water; his
            body, from his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg

            to the body of one of the other immortals. But below his body was
            like a great fish’s, forking this way and that. He moved with
            fins that were like the horns of the new moon. Triton helped
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> along until they came into
            the open sea. Then he plunged down into the abyss. The heroes
            shouted their thanks to him. Then they looked at each other and
            embraced each other with joy, for the sea that touched upon the
            land of Greece was open before them.</p>

          sank; then that star came that bids the shepherd bring his flock to
          the fold, that brings the wearied plowman to his rest. But no rest
          did that star bring to the Argonauts. The breeze that filled the
          sail died down; they furled the sail and lowered the mast; then,
          once again, they pulled at the oars. All night they rowed, and all
          day, and again when the next day came on. Then they saw the island
          that is halfway to Greece—the great and fair island of Crete.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was Theseus
          who first saw Crete—Theseus who was to come to Crete upon another
          ship. They drew the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> near the great island; they
          wanted water, and they were fain to rest there. <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Minos, the
          great king, ruled over Crete. He left the guarding of the island to
          one of the race of bronze, to Talos, who had lived on after the
          rest of the bronze men had been destroyed. Thrice a day would Talos
          stride around the island; his brazen feet were tireless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now Talos saw
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> drawing near. He took up
          great rocks and he hurled them at the heroes, and very quickly they
          had to draw their ship out of range.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were
          wearied and their thirst was consuming them. But still that bronze
          man stood there ready to sink their ship with the great rocks that
          he took up in his hands. Medea stood forward upon the ship, ready
          to use her spells against the man of bronze.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In body and
          limbs he was made of bronze and in these he was invulnerable. But
          beneath a sinew in his ankle there was a vein that ran up to his
          neck and that was covered by a thin skin. If that vein were broken
          Talos would perish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea did not
          know about this vein when she stood forward upon the ship to use
          her spells against him. Upon a cliff of Crete, all gleaming, stood
          that huge man of bronze. Then, as she was ready to fling her spells
          against him, Medea thought upon the words that Arete, the wise
          queen, had given her—that she was not to use spells and not to
          practice against the life of any one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But she knew
          that there was no impiety in using spells and practicing against
          Talos, for Zeus had already doomed all his <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page178">[pg 178]</span> race. She stood upon the ship, and
          with her Magic Song she enchanted him. He whirled round and round.
          He struck his ankle against a jutting stone. The vein broke, and
          that which was the blood of the bronze man flowed out of him like
          molten lead. He stood towering upon the cliff. Like a pine upon a
          mountaintop that the woodman had left half hewn through and that a
          mighty wind pitches against, Talos stood upon his tireless feet,
          swaying to and fro. Then, emptied of all his strength, Minos’s man
          of bronze fell into the Cretan Sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The heroes
          landed. That night they lay upon the land of Crete and rested and
          refreshed themselves. When dawn came they drew water from a spring,
          and once more they went on board the <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A day came when
          the helmsman said, <span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow we shall see
          the shore of Thessaly, and by sunset we shall be in the harbor of
          Pagasæ. Soon, O voyagers, we shall be back in the city from which
          we went to gain the Golden Fleece.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason
          brought Medea to the front of the ship so that they might watch
          together for Thessaly, the homeland. The Mountain Pelion came into
          sight. Jason exulted as he looked upon that mountain; again he told
          Medea about Chiron, the ancient centaur, and about the days of his
          youth in the forests of Pelion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The <em class=

          darkness such as there was on that night. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page179">[pg 179]</span> They called that night afterward the
          Pall of Darkness. To the heroes upon the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> it
          seemed as if black chaos had come over the world again; they knew
          not whether they were adrift upon the sea or upon the River of
          Hades. No star pierced the darkness nor no beam from the moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> After a night
          that seemed many nights the dawn came. In the sunrise they saw the
          land of Thessaly with its mountain, its forests, and its fields.
          They hailed each other as if they had met after a long parting.
          They raised the mast and unfurled the sail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But not toward
          Pagasæ did they go. For now the voice of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          came to them, shaking their hearts: Jason and Orpheus, Castor and
          Polydeuces, Zetes and Calais, Peleus and Telamon, Theseus, Admetus,
          Nestor, and Atalanta, heard the cry of their ship. And the voice of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> warned them not to go into
          the harbor of Pagasæ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As they stood
          upon the ship, looking toward Iolcus, sorrow came over all the
          heroes, such sorrow as made their hearts nearly break. For long
          they stood there in utter numbness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Admetus
          spoke—Admetus who was the happiest of all those who went in quest
          of the Golden Fleece. <span class="tei tei-q">“Although we may not
          go into the harbor of Pagasæ, nor into the city of Iolcus,”</span>
          Admetus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“still we have come to the
          land of Greece. There are other harbors and other cities that we
          may go into. And in all the places that we go to we will be
          honored, for we have gone through toils and dangers, and we have
          brought to Greece the famous Fleece of Gold.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Admetus
          said, and their spirits came back again to the heroes—came back to
          all of them save Jason. The rest had other cities to go to, and
          fathers and mothers and friends to greet them in other places, but
          for Jason there was only Iolcus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea took his
          hand, and sorrow for him overcame her. For Medea could divine what
          had happened in Iolcus and why it was that the heroes might not go
          there.</p>

          Corinth, welcomed them and gave great honor to the heroes who had
          faced such labors and such dangers to bring the world’s wonder to
          Greece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts

          ravaged Prince Meleagrus’s country. After that they separated, each
          one going to his own land. Jason came back to Corinth where Medea
          stayed. And in Corinth he had tidings of the happenings in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Pelias now

          Nestor and Helen’s brothers Polydeuces and Castor. And, most noted
          of all, there came the Arcadian huntress maid, Atalanta.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Beautiful they
          all thought her when they knew her aboard the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          But even more beautiful Atalanta seemed to the heroes when she came
          amongst them in her hunting gear. Her lovely hair hung in two bands
          across her shoulders, and over her breast hung an ivory quiver
          filled with arrows. They said that her face with its wide and
          steady eyes was maidenly for a boy’s, and boyish for a maiden’s
          face. Swiftly she moved with her head held high, and there was not
          one amongst the heroes who did not say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, happy would that man be whom Atalanta the unwedded
          would take for her husband!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> All the heroes
          said it, but the one who said it most feelingly was the prince of
          Calydon, young Meleagrus. He more than the other heroes felt the
          wonder of Atalanta’s beauty. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now the boar
          they had come to hunt was a monster boar. It had come into Calydon
          and it was laying waste the fields and orchards and destroying the
          people’s cattle and horses. That boar had been sent into Calydon by
          an angry divinity. For when Œneus, the king of the country, was
          making sacrifice to the gods in thanksgiving for a bounteous
          harvest, he had neglected to make sacrifice to the goddess of the
          wild things, Artemis. In her anger Artemis had sent the monster
          boar to lay waste Œneus’s realm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was a
          monster boar indeed—one as huge as a bull, with tusks as great as
          an elephant’s; the bristles on its back stood up like spear points,
          and the hot breath of the creature withered the growth on the
          ground. The boar tore up the corn in the fields and trampled down
          the vines with their clusters and heavy bunches of grapes; also it
          rushed against the cattle and destroyed them in the fields. And no
          hounds the huntsmen were able to bring could stand before it. And
          so it came to pass that men had to leave their farms and take
          refuge behind the walls of the city because of the ravages of the
          boar. It was then that the rulers of Calydon sent for the heroes of
          the quest to join with them in hunting the monster.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Calydon itself
          sent Prince Meleagrus and his two uncles, Plexippus and Toxeus.
          They were brothers to Meleagrus’s mother, Althæa. Now Althæa was a
          woman who had sight to see mysterious things, but who had also a
          wayward and passionate heart. Once, after her son Meleagrus was
          born, she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span> saw
          the three Fates sitting by her hearth. They were spinning the
          threads of her son’s life, and as they spun they sang to each
          other, <span class="tei tei-q">“An equal span of life we give to
          the newborn child, and to the billet of wood that now rests above
          the blaze of the fire.”</span> Hearing what the Fates sang and
          understanding it Althæa had sprung up from her bed, had seized the
          billet of wood, and had taken it out of the fire before the flames
          had burnt into it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That billet of
          wood lay in her chest, hidden away. And Meleagrus nor any one else
          save Althæa knew of it, nor knew that the prince’s life would last
          only for the space it would be kept from the burning. On the day of
          the hunting he appeared as the strongest and bravest of the youths
          of Calydon. And he knew not, poor Meleagrus, that the love for
          Atalanta that had sprung into his heart was to bring to the fire
          the billet of wood on which his life depended.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As Atalanta
          went, the bow in her hands, Prince Meleagrus pressed behind her.
          Then came Jason and Peleus, Telamon, Theseus and Nestor. Behind
          them came Meleagrus’s dark-browed uncles, Plexippus and Toxeus.
          They came to a forest that covered the side of a mountain. Huntsmen
          had assembled here with hounds held in leashes and with nets to
          hold the rushing quarry. And when they had all gathered together
          they went through the forest on the track of the monster boar.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was easy to
          track the boar, for it had left a broad trail through the forest.
          The heroes and the huntsmen pressed on. They came to a marshy
          covert where the boar had its lair. There was a thickness of osiers
          and willows and tall bullrushes, making a place that it was hard
          for the hunters to go through.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They roused the
          boar with the blare of horns and it came rushing out. Foam was on
          its tusks, and its eyes had in them the blaze of fire. On the boar
          came, breaking down the thicket in its rush. But the heroes stood
          steadily with the points of their spears toward the monster.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The hounds were
          loosed from their leashes and they dashed toward the boar. The boar
          slashed them with its tusks and trampled them into the ground.
          Jason flung his spear. The spear went wide of the mark. Another,
          Arcas, cast his, but the wood, not the point of the spear, struck
          the boar, rousing it further. Then its eyes flamed, and like a
          great stone shot from a catapult the boar rushed on the huntsmen
          who were stationed to the right. In that rush it flung two youths
          prone upon the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then might
          Nestor have missed his going to Troy and his part in that story,
          for the boar swerved around and was upon him in an instant. Using
          his spear as a leaping pole he vaulted upward and caught the
          branches of a tree as the monster dashed the spear down in its
          rush. In rage the beast tore at the trunk of the tree. The heroes
          might have been scattered at this moment, for Telamon had fallen,
          tripped by the roots of a tree, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page187">[pg 187]</span> and Peleus had had to throw himself upon
          him to pull him out of the way of danger, if Polydeuces and Castor
          had not dashed up to their aid. They came riding upon high white
          horses, spears in their hands. The brothers cast their spears, but
          neither spear struck the monster boar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the boar
          turned and was for drawing back into the thicket. They might have
          lost it then, for its retreat was impenetrable. But before it got
          clear away Atalanta put an arrow to the string, drew the bow to her
          shoulder, and let the arrow fly. It struck the boar, and a patch of
          blood was seen upon its bristles. Prince Meleagrus shouted out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O first to strike the monster! Honor
          indeed shall you receive for this, Arcadian maid.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> His uncles were
          made wroth by this speech, as was another, the Arcadian, rough
          Arcas. Arcas dashed forward, holding in his hands a two-headed axe.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Heroes and huntsmen,”</span> he cried,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you shall see how a man’s strokes surpass
          a girl’s.”</span> He faced the boar, standing on tiptoe with his
          axe raised for the stroke. Meleagrus’s uncles shouted to encourage
          him. But the boar’s tusks tore him before Arcas’s axe fell, and the
          Arcadian was trampled upon the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The boar,
          roused again by Atalanta’s arrow, turned on the hunters. Jason
          hurled a spear again. It swerved and struck a hound and pinned it
          to the ground. Then, speaking the name of Atalanta, Meleagrus
          sprang before the heroes and the huntsmen. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page188">[pg 188]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He had two
          spears in his hands. The first missed and stuck quivering in the
          ground. But the second went right through the back of the monster
          boar. It whirled round and round, spouting out blood and foam.
          Meleagrus pressed on, and drove his hunting knife through the
          shoulders of the monster.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> His uncles,
          Plexippus and Toxeus, were the first to come to where the monster
          boar was lying outstretched. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is well,
          the deed you have done, boy,”</span> said one; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it is well that none of the strangers to our country
          slew the boar. Now will the head and tusks of the monster adorn our
          hall, and men will know that the arms of our house can well protect
          this land.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But one word
          only did Meleagrus say, and that word was the name, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Atalanta.”</span> The maiden came and Meleagrus, his
          spear upon the head, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take, O fair
          Arcadian, the spoil of the chase. All know that it was you who
          inflicted the first wound upon the boar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Plexippus and
          Toxeus tried to push him away, as if Meleagrus was still a boy
          under their tutoring. He shouted to them to stand off, and then he
          hacked out the terrible tusks and held them toward Atalanta.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She would have
          taken them, for she, who had never looked lovingly upon a youth,
          was moved by the beauty and the generosity of Prince Meleagrus. She
          would have taken from him the spoil of the chase. But as she held
          out her arms Meleagrus’s uncles struck them with the poles of their
          spears. Heavy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span>
          marks were made on the maiden’s white arms. Madness then possessed
          Meleagrus, and he took up his spear and thrust it, first into the
          body of Plexippus and then into the body of Toxeus. His thrusts
          were terrible, for he was filled with the fierceness of the hunt,
          and his uncles fell down in death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then a great
          horror came over all the heroes. They raised up the bodies of
          Plexippus and Toxeus and carried them on their spears away from the
          place of the hunting and toward the temple of the gods. Meleagrus
          crouched down upon the ground in horror of what he had done.
          Atalanta stood beside him, her hand upon his head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Althæa was in
          the temple making sacrifice to the gods. She saw men come in
          carrying across their spears the bodies of two men. She looked and
          she saw that the dead men were her two brothers, Plexippus and
          Toxeus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then she beat
          her breast and she filled the temple with the cries of her
          lamentation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who has slain my brothers?
          Who has slain my brothers?”</span> she kept crying out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then she was
          told that her son Meleagrus had slain her brothers. She had no
          tears to shed then, and in a hard voice she asked, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why did my son slay Plexippus and Toxeus, his
          uncles?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The one who was
          wroth with Atalanta, Arcas the Arcadian, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page190">[pg 190]</span> came to her and told her that her
          brothers had been slain because of a quarrel about the girl
          Atalanta.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My brothers have been slain because a girl bewitched
          my son; then accursed be that son of mine,”</span> Althæa cried.
          She took off the gold-fringed robe of a priestess, and she put on a
          black robe of mourning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Her brothers,
          the only sons of her father, had been slain, and for the sake of a
          girl. The image of Atalanta came before her, and she felt she could
          punish dreadfully her son. But her son was not there to punish; he
          was far away, and the girl for whose sake he had killed Plexippus
          and Toxeus was with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The rage she
          had went back into her heart and made her truly mad. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I gave Meleagrus life when I might have let it go from
          him with the burning billet of wood,”</span> she cried,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and now he has taken the lives of my
          brothers.”</span> And then her thought went to the billet of wood
          that was hidden in the chest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Back to her
          house she went, and when she went within she saw a fire of pine
          knots burning upon the hearth. As she looked upon their burning a
          scorching pain went through her. But she went from the hearth,
          nevertheless, and into the inner room. There stood the chest that
          she had not opened for years. She opened it now, and out of it she
          took the billet of wood that had on it the mark of the burning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She brought it
          to the hearth fire. Four times she went to throw it into the fire,
          and four times she stayed her hand. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page191">[pg 191]</span> fire was before her, but it was in her
          too. She saw the images of her brothers lying dead, and, saying
          that he who had slain them should lose his life, she threw the
          billet of wood into the fire of pine knots.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Straightway it
          caught fire and began to burn. And Althæa cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let him die, my son, and let naught remain; let all
          perish with my brothers, even the kingdom that Œneus, my husband,
          founded.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then she turned
          away and remained stiffly standing by the hearth, the life withered
          up within her. Her daughters came and tried to draw her away, but
          they could not—her two daughters, Gorge and Deianira.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Meleagrus was
          crouching upon the ground with Atalanta watching beside him. Now he
          stood up, and taking her hand he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
          me go with you to the temple of the gods where I shall strive to
          make atonement for the deed I have done to-day.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She went with
          him. But even as they came to the street of the city a sharp and a
          burning pain seized upon Meleagrus. More and more burning it grew,
          and weaker and weaker he became. He could not have moved further if
          it had not been for the aid of Atalanta. Jason and Peleus lifted
          him across the threshold and carried him into the temple of the
          gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They laid him
          down with his head upon Atalanta’s lap. The pain within him grew
          fiercer and fiercer, but at last it died down as the burning billet
          of wood sank down into the ashes. The heroes of the quest stood
          around, all overcome with woe. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page192">[pg 192]</span> the street they heard the lamentations
          for Plexippus and Toxeus, for Prince Meleagrus, and for the passing
          of the kingdom founded by Œneus. Atalanta left the temple, and
          attended by the two brothers on the white horses, Polydeuces and
          Castor, she went back to Arcady.</p>

          PELEUS came on his ship to a bay on the coast of Thessaly. His
          painted ship lay between two great rocks, and from its poop he saw
          a sight that enchanted him. Out from the sea, riding on a dolphin,
          came a lovely maiden. And by the radiance of her face and limbs
          Peleus knew her for one of the immortal goddesses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now Peleus had
          borne himself so nobly in all things that he had won the favor of
          the gods themselves. Zeus, who is highest amongst the gods, had
          made this promise to Peleus: he would honor him as no one amongst
          the sons of men had been honored before, for he would give him an
          immortal goddess to be his bride.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She who came
          out of the sea went into a cave that was overgrown with vines and
          roses. Peleus looked into the cave and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page193">[pg 193]</span> he saw her sleeping upon skins of the
          beasts of the sea. His heart was enchanted by the sight, and he
          knew that his life would be broken if he did not see this goddess
          day after day. So he went back to his ship and he prayed:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O Zeus, now I claim the promise that you
          once made to me. Let it be that this goddess come with me, or else
          plunge my ship and me beneath the waves of the sea.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And when Peleus
          said this he looked over the land and the water for a sign from
          Zeus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Even then the
          goddess sleeping in the cave had dreams such as had never before
          entered that peaceful resting place of hers. She dreamt that she
          was drawn away from the deep and the wide sea. She dreamt that she
          was brought to a place that was strange and unfree to her. And as
          she lay in the cave, sleeping, tears that might never come into the
          eyes of an immortal lay around her heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Peleus,
          standing on his painted ship, saw a rainbow touch upon the sea. He
          knew by that sign that Iris, the messenger of Zeus, had come down
          through the air. Then a strange sight came before his eyes. Out of
          the sea rose the head of a man; wrinkled and bearded it was, and
          the eyes were very old. Peleus knew that he who was there before
          him was Nereus, the ancient one of the sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Said old
          Nereus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast prayed to Zeus, and I am
          here to speak an answer to thy prayer. She whom you have looked
          upon is Thetis, the goddess of the sea. Very loath will she be
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span> to take
          Zeus’s command and wed with thee. It is her desire to remain in the
          sea, unwedded, and she has refused marriage even with one of the
          immortal gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said
          Peleus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus promised me an immortal
          bride. If Thetis may not be mine I cannot wed any other, goddess or
          mortal maiden.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then thou thyself wilt have to master Thetis,”</span>
          said Nereus, the wise one of the sea. <span class="tei tei-q">“If
          she is mastered by thee, she cannot go back to the sea. She will
          strive with all her strength and all her wit to escape from thee;
          but thou must hold her no matter what she does, and no matter how
          she shows herself. When thou hast seen her again as thou didst see
          her at first, thou wilt know that thou hast mastered her.”</span>
          And when he had said this to Peleus, Nereus, the ancient one of the
          sea, went under the waves.</p>

          the cave. Kneeling beside her he looked down upon the goddess. The
          dress she wore was like green and silver mail. Her face and limbs
          were pearly, but through them came the radiance that belongs to the
          immortals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He touched the
          hair of the goddess of the sea, the yellow hair that was so long
          that it might cover her all over. As he touched her hair she
          started up, wakening suddenly out of her sleep. His hands touched
          her hands and held them. Now he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page195">[pg 195]</span> knew that if he should loose his hold
          upon her she would escape from him into the depths of the sea, and
          that thereafter no command from the immortals would bring her to
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She changed
          into a white bird that strove to bear itself away. Peleus held to
          its wings and struggled with the bird. She changed and became a
          tree. Around the trunk of the tree Peleus clung. She changed once
          more, and this time her form became terrible: a spotted leopard she
          was now, with burning eyes; but Peleus held to the neck of the
          fierce-appearing leopard and was not affrighted by the burning
          eyes. Then she changed and became as he had seen her first—a lovely
          maiden, with the brow of a goddess, and with long yellow hair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But now there
          was no radiance in her face or in her limbs. She looked past
          Peleus, who held her, and out to the wide sea. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who is he,”</span> she cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who has been given this mastery over me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then said the
          hero: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Peleus, and Zeus has given me
          the mastery over thee. Wilt thou come with me, Thetis? Thou art my
          bride, given me by him who is highest amongst the gods, and if thou
          wilt come with me, thou wilt always be loved and reverenced by
          me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Unwillingly I leave the sea,”</span> she cried,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“unwillingly I go with thee,
          Peleus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But life in the
          sea was not for her any more now that she was mastered. She went to
          Peleus’s ship and she went to Phthia, his country. And when the
          hero and the sea goddess were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          came to their hall and brought the bride and the bridegroom
          wondrous gifts. The three sisters who are called the Fates came
          also. These wise and ancient women said that the son born of the
          marriage of Peleus and Thetis would be a man greater than Peleus
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now although a
          son was born to her, and although this son had something of the
          radiance of the immortals about him, Thetis remained forlorn and
          estranged. Nothing that her husband did was pleasing to her. Prince
          Peleus was in fear that the wildness of the sea would break out in
          her, and that some great harm would be wrought in his house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One night he
          wakened suddenly. He saw the fire upon his hearth and he saw a
          figure standing by the fire. It was Thetis, his wife. The fire was
          blazing around something that she held in her hands. And while she
          stood there she was singing to herself a strange-sounding song.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then he saw
          what Thetis held in her hands and what the fire was blazing around;
          it was the child, Achilles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Prince Peleus
          sprang from the bed and caught Thetis around the waist and lifted
          her and the child away from the blazing fire. He put them both upon
          the bed, and he took from her the child that she held by the heel.
          His heart was wild within him, for the thought that wildness had
          come over his wife, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
          197]</span> that she was bent upon destroying their child. But
          Thetis looked on him from under those goddess brows of hers and she
          said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“By the divine power that I
          still possess I would have made the child invulnerable; but the
          heel by which I held him has not been endued by the fire and in
          that place some day he may be stricken. All that the fire covered
          is invulnerable, and no weapon that strikes there can destroy his
          life. His heel I cannot now make invulnerable, for now the divine
          power is gone out of me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When she said
          this Thetis looked full upon her husband, and never had she seemed
          so unforgiving as she was then. All the divine radiance that had
          remained with her was gone from her now, and she seemed a
          white-faced and bitter-thinking woman. And when Peleus saw that
          such a great bitterness faced him he fled from his house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He traveled far
          from his own land, and first he went to the help of Heracles, who
          was then in the midst of his mighty labors. Heracles was building a
          wall around a city. Peleus labored, helping him to raise the wall
          for King Laomedon. Then, one night, as he walked by the wall he had
          helped to build, he heard voices speaking out of the earth. And one
          voice said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why has Peleus striven so hard
          to raise a wall that his son shall fight hard to overthrow?”</span>
          No voice replied. The wall was built, and Peleus departed. The city
          around which the wall was built was the great city of Troy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In whatever
          place he went Peleus was followed by the hatred <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span> of the people of the sea,
          and above all by the hatred of the nymph who is called Psamathe.
          Far, far from his own country he went, and at last he came to a
          country of bright valleys that was ruled over by a kindly king—by
          Ceyx, who was called the Son of the Morning Star.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Bright of face
          and kindly and peaceable in all his ways was this king, and kindly
          and peaceable was the land that he ruled over. And when Prince
          Peleus went to him to beg for his protection, and to beg for
          unfurrowed fields where he might graze his cattle, Ceyx raised him
          up from where he knelt. <span class="tei tei-q">“Peaceable and
          plentiful is the land,”</span> he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and all who come here may have peace and a chance to
          earn their food. Live where you will, O stranger, and take the
          unfurrowed fields by the seashore for pasture for your
          cattle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Peace came into
          Peleus’s heart as he looked into the untroubled face of Ceyx, and
          as he looked over the bright valleys of the land he had come into.
          He brought his cattle to the unfurrowed fields by the seashore and
          he left herdsmen there to tend them. And as he walked along these
          bright valleys he thought upon his wife and upon his son Achilles,
          and there were gentle feelings in his breast. But then he thought
          upon the enmity of Psamathe, the woman of the sea, and great
          trouble came over him again. He felt he could not stay in the
          palace of the kindly king. He went where his herdsmen camped and he
          lived with them. But the sea was very near and its sound tormented
          him, and as the days went by, Peleus, wild looking <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span> and shaggy, became more
          and more unlike the hero whom once the gods themselves had
          honored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One day as he
          was standing near the palace having speech with the king, a
          herdsman ran to him and cried out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Peleus,
          Peleus, a dread thing has happened in the unfurrowed
          fields.”</span> And when he had got his breath the herdsman told of
          the thing that had happened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They had
          brought the herd down to the sea. Suddenly, from the marshes where
          the sea and land came together, a monstrous beast rushed out upon
          the herd; like a wolf this beast was, but with mouth and jaws that
          were more terrible than a wolf’s even. The beast seized upon the
          cattle. Yet it was not hunger that made it fierce, for the beasts
          that it killed it tore, but did not devour. It rushed on and on,
          killing and tearing more and more of the herd. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Soon,”</span> said the herdsman, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it will have destroyed all in the herd, and then it
          will not spare to destroy the other flocks and herds that are in
          the land.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Peleus was
          stricken to hear that his herd was being destroyed, but more
          stricken to know that the land of a friendly king would be ravaged,
          and ravaged on his account. For he knew that the terrible beast
          that had come from where the sea and the land joined had been sent
          by Psamathe. He went up on the tower that stood near the king’s
          palace. He was able to look out on the sea and able to look over
          all the land. And looking across the bright valleys he saw the
          dread beast. He saw it rush through his own mangled cattle and fall
          upon the herds of the kindly king. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page200">[pg 200]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He looked
          toward the sea and he prayed to Psamathe to spare the land that he
          had come to. But, even as he prayed, he knew that Psamathe would
          not harken to him. Then he made a prayer to Thetis, to his wife who
          had seemed so unforgiving. He prayed her to deal with Psamathe so
          that the land of Ceyx would not be altogether destroyed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As he looked
          from the tower he saw the king come forth with arms in his hands
          for the slaying of the terrible beast. Peleus felt fear for the
          life of the kindly king. Down from the tower he came, and taking up
          his spear he went with Ceyx.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Soon, in one of
          the brightest of the valleys, they came upon the beast; they came
          between it and a herd of silken-coated cattle. Seeing the men it
          rushed toward them with blood and foam upon its jaws. Then Peleus
          knew that the spears they carried would be of little use against
          the raging beast. His only thought was to struggle with it so that
          the king might be able to save himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Again he lifted
          up his hands and prayed to Thetis to draw away Psamathe’s enmity.
          The beast rushed toward them; but suddenly it stopped. The bristles
          upon its body seemed to stiffen. The gaping jaws became fixed. The
          hounds that were with them dashed upon the beast, but then fell
          back with yelps of disappointment. And when Peleus and Ceyx came to
          where it stood they found that the monstrous beast had been turned
          into stone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And a stone it
          remains in that bright valley, a wonder to all <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span> the men of Ceyx’s land.
          The country was spared the ravages of the beast. And the heart of
          Peleus was uplifted to think that Thetis had harkened to his prayer
          and had prevailed upon Psamathe to forego her enmity. Not
          altogether unforgiving was his wife to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That day he
          went from the land of the bright valleys, from the land ruled over
          by the kindly Ceyx, and he came back to rugged Phthia, his own
          country. When he came near his hall he saw two at the doorway
          awaiting him. Thetis stood there, and the child Achilles was by her
          side. The radiance of the immortals was in her face no longer, but
          there was a glow there, a glow of welcome for the hero Peleus. And
          thus Peleus, long tormented by the enmity of the sea-born ones,
          came back to the wife he had won from the sea.</p>

          Theseus made up his mind to go in search of his father, the unknown
          king, and Medea, the wise woman, counseled him to go to Athens.
          After the hunt in Calydon he set forth. On his way he fought with
          and slew two robbers who harassed countries and treated people
          unjustly. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The first was
          Sinnias. He was a robber who slew men cruelly by tying them to
          strong branches of trees and letting the branches fly apart. On him
          Theseus had no mercy. The second was a robber also, Procrustes: he
          had a great iron bed on which he made his captives lie; if they
          were too long for that bed he chopped pieces off them, and if they
          were too short he stretched out their bodies with terrible racks.
          On him, likewise, Theseus had no mercy; he slew Procrustes and gave
          liberty to his captives.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The King of
          Athens at the time was named Ægeus. He was father of Theseus, but
          neither Theseus nor he knew that this was so. Æthra was his mother,
          and she was the daughter of the King of Trœzen. Before Theseus was
          born his father left a great sword under a stone, telling Æthra
          that the boy was to have the sword when he was able to move that
          stone away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Ægeus was
          old and fearful now: there were wars and troubles in the city;
          besides, there was in his palace an evil woman, a witch, to whom
          the king listened. This woman heard that a proud and fearless young
          man had come into Athens, and she at once thought to destroy
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So the witch
          spoke to the fearful king, and she made him believe that this
          stranger had come into Athens to make league with his enemies and
          destroy him. Such was her power over Ægeus that she was able to
          persuade him to invite the stranger youth to a feast in the palace,
          and to give him a cup that would have poison in it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus came to
          the palace. He sat down to the banquet <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page203">[pg 203]</span> with the king. But before the cup was
          brought something moved him to stand up and draw forth the sword
          that he carried. Fearfully the king looked upon the sword. Then he
          saw the heavy ivory hilt with the curious carving on it, and he
          knew that this was the sword that he had once laid under the stone
          near the palace of the King of Trœzen. He questioned Theseus as to
          how he had come by the sword, and Theseus told him how Æthra, his
          mother, had shown him where it was hidden, and how he had been able
          to take it from under the stone before he was grown a youth. More
          and more Ægeus questioned him, and he came to know that the youth
          before him was his son indeed. He dashed down the cup that had been
          brought to the table, and he shook all over with the thought of how
          near he had been to a terrible crime. The witchwoman watched all
          that passed; mounting on a car drawn by dragons she made flight
          from Athens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now the
          people of the city, knowing that it was he who had slain the
          robbers Sinnias and Procrustes, rejoiced to have Theseus amongst
          them. When he appeared as their prince they rejoiced still more.
          Soon he was able to bring to an end the wars in the city and the
          troubles that afflicted Athens.</p>

          kingdom of King Ægeus. But the people of Athens slew the son of
          King Minos, and because Ægeus had not given him the protection that
          a king should have given a stranger come upon such an errand he was
          deemed to have some part in the guilt of his slaying.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Minos, the
          great king, was wroth, and he made war on Athens, wreaking great

          themselves were wroth with Athens; they punished the people with
          famine, making even the rivers dry up. The Athenians went to the
          oracle and asked Apollo what they should do to have their guilt
          taken away. Apollo made answer that they should make peace with
          Minos and fulfill all his demands.</p>

          and troubles in Athens there was a deed of evil that Ægeus, his
          father, had some guilt in.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The demands
          that King Minos made upon Athens were terrible. He demanded that
          the Athenians should send into Crete every year seven youths and
          seven maidens as a price for the life of his son. And these youths
          and maidens were not to meet death merely, nor were they to be
          reared in slavery—they were to be sent that a monster called the
          Minotaur might devour them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Youths and
          maidens had been sent, and for the third time the messengers of
          King Minos were coming to Athens. The tribute for the Minotaur was
          to be chosen by lot. The fathers <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page205">[pg 205]</span> and mothers were in fear and trembling,
          for each man and woman thought that his or her son or daughter
          would be taken for a prey for the Minotaur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They came
          together, the people of Athens, and they drew the lots fearfully.
          And on the throne above them all sat their pale-faced king, Ægeus,
          the father of Theseus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Before the
          first lot was drawn Theseus turned to all of them and said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“People of Athens, it is not right that
          your children should go and that I, who am the son of King Ægeus,
          should remain behind. Surely, if any of the youths of Athens should
          face the dread monster of Crete, I should face it. There is one lot
          that you may leave undrawn. I will go to Crete.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> His father, on
          hearing the speech of Theseus, came down from his throne and
          pleaded with him, begging him not to go. But the will of Theseus
          was set; he would go with the others and face the Minotaur. And he
          reminded his father of how the people had complained, saying that
          if Ægeus had done the duty of a king, Minos’s son would not have
          been slain and the tribute to the Minotaur would have not been
          demanded. It was the passing about of such complaints that had led
          to the war and troubles that Theseus found on his coming to
          Athens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Also Theseus
          told his father and told the people that he had hope in his
          hands—that the hands that were strong enough to slay Sinnias and
          Procrustes, the giant robbers, would be strong enough to slay the
          dread monster of Crete. His father at last consented to his going.
          And Theseus was able to make the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page206">[pg 206]</span> people willing to believe that he would
          be able to overcome the Minotaur, and so put an end to the terrible
          tribute that was being exacted from them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> With six other
          youths and seven maidens Theseus went on board of the ship that
          every year brought to Crete the grievous tribute. This ship always
          sailed with black sails. But before it sailed this time King Ægeus
          gave to Nausitheus, the master of the ship, a white sail to take
          with him. And he begged Theseus, that in case he should be able to
          overcome the monster, to hoist the white sail he had given. Theseus
          promised he would do this. His father would watch for the return of
          the ship, and if the sail were black he would know that the
          Minotaur had dealt with his son as it had dealt with the other
          youths who had gone from Athens. And if the sail were white Ægeus
          would have indeed cause to rejoice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now the
          black-sailed ship had come to Crete, and the youths and maidens of
          Athens looked from its deck on Knossos, the marvelous city that
          Dædalus the builder had built for King Minos. And they saw the
          palace of the king, the red and black palace in which was the
          labyrinth, made also by Dædalus, where the dread Minotaur was
          hidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In fear they
          looked upon the city and the palace. But not in fear did Theseus
          look, but in wonder at the magnificence of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page207">[pg 207]</span> it all—the harbor with its great steps
          leading up into the city, the far-spreading palace all red and
          black, and the crowds of ships with their white and red sails. They
          were brought through the city of Knossos to the palace of the king.
          And there Theseus looked upon Minos. In a great red chamber on
          which was painted the sign of the axe, King Minos sat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On a low throne
          he sat, holding in his hand a scepter on which a bird was perched.
          Not in fear, but steadily, did Theseus look upon the king. And he
          saw that Minos had the face of one who has thought long upon
          troublesome things, and that his eyes were strangely dark and deep.
          The king noted that the eyes of Theseus were upon him, and he made
          a sign with his head to an attendant and the attendant laid his
          hand upon him and brought Theseus to stand beside the king. Minos
          questioned him as to who he was and what lands he had been in, and
          when he learned that Theseus was the son of Ægeus, the King of
          Athens, he said the name of his son who had been slain,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Androgeus, Androgeus,”</span> over and
          over again, and then spoke no more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> While he stood
          there beside the king there came into the chamber three maidens;
          one of them, Theseus knew, was the daughter of Minos. Not like the
          maidens of Greece were the princess and her two attendants: instead
          of having on flowing garments and sandals and wearing their hair
          bound, they had on dresses of gleaming material that were tight at
          the waists and bell-shaped; the hair that streamed on their
          shoulders was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
          made wavy; they had on high shoes of a substance that shone like
          glass. Never had Theseus looked upon maidens who were so
          strange.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They spoke to
          the king in the strange Cretan language; then Minos’s daughter made
          reverence to her father, and they went from the chamber. Theseus
          watched them as they went through a long passage, walking slowly on
          their high-heeled shoes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Through the
          same passage the youths and maidens of Athens were afterward
          brought. They came into a great hall. The walls were red and on
          them were paintings in black—pictures of great bulls with girls and
          slender youths struggling with them. It was a place for games and
          shows, and Theseus stood with the youths and maidens of Athens and
          with the people of the palace and watched what was happening.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They saw women
          charming snakes; then they saw a boxing match, and afterward they
          all looked on a bout of wrestling. Theseus looked past the
          wrestlers and he saw, at the other end of the hall, the daughter of
          King Minos and her two attendant maidens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One
          broad-shouldered and bearded man overthrew all the wrestlers who
          came to grips with him. He stood there boastfully, and Theseus was
          made angry by the man’s arrogance. Then, when no other wrestler
          would come against him, he turned to leave the arena.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Theseus
          stood in his way and pushed him back. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page209">[pg 209]</span> boastful man laid hands upon him and
          pulled him into the arena. He strove to throw Theseus as he had
          thrown the others; but he soon found that the youth from Greece was
          a wrestler, too, and that he would have to strive hard to overthrow
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> More eagerly
          than they had watched anything else the people of the palace and
          the youths and maidens of Athens watched the bout between Theseus
          and the lordly wrestler. Those from Athens who looked upon him now
          thought that they had never seen Theseus look so tall and so
          conquering before; beside the slender, dark-haired people of Crete
          he looked like a statue of one of the gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Very adroit was
          the Cretan wrestler, and Theseus had to use all his strength to
          keep upon his feet; but soon he mastered the tricks that the
          wrestler was using against him. Then the Cretan left aside his
          tricks and began to use all his strength to throw Theseus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Steadily
          Theseus stood and the Cretan wrestler was spent and gasping in the
          effort to throw him. Then Theseus made him feel his grip. He bent
          him backward, and then, using all his strength suddenly, forced him
          to the ground. All were filled with wonder at the strength and
          power of this youth from overseas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Food and wine
          were given the youths and maidens of Athens, and they with Theseus
          were let wander through the grounds of the palace. But they could
          make no escape, for guards followed them and the way to the ships
          was filled with strangers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span> who would not let them pass. They talked to each other
          about the Minotaur, and there was fear in every word they said. But
          Theseus went from one to the other, telling them that perhaps there
          was a way by which he could come to the monster and destroy it. And
          the youths and maidens, remembering how he had overthrown the
          lordly wrestler, were comforted a little, thinking that Theseus
          might indeed be able to destroy the Minotaur and so save all of
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus was
          awakened by some one touching him. He arose and he saw a dark-faced
          servant, who beckoned to him. He left the little chamber where he
          had been sleeping, and then he saw outside one who wore the strange
          dress of the Cretans.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When Theseus

          upon his arm, and she led him into the chamber where Minos had sat.

          back to me. Theseus, now I put into your hand the thread that will
          guide you through all the windings of the labyrinth. And outside
          the place where the Minotaur is you will find another thread to
          guide you back.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A cone was on
          the ground and it had a thread fastened to it. Ariadne gave Theseus
          the thread and the cone to wind it around. The thread as he held it
          and wound it around the cone would bring him through all the
          windings and turnings of the labyrinth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She left him,
          and Theseus went on. Winding the thread around the cone he went
          along a wide passage in the vault. He turned and came into a
          passage that was very long. He came to a place in this passage
          where a door seemed to be, but within the frame of the doorway
          there was only a blank wall. But below that doorway there was a
          flight of six steps, and down these steps the thread led him. On he
          went, and he crossed the marks that he himself had made in the
          dust, and he thought he must have come back to the place where he
          had parted from Ariadne. He went on, and he saw before him a flight
          of steps. The thread did not lead up the steps; it led into the
          most winding of passages. So sudden were the turnings in it that
          one could not see three steps before one. He was <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span> dazed by the turnings of
          this passage, but still he went on. He went up winding steps and
          then along a narrow wall. The wall overhung a broad flight of
          steps, and Theseus had to jump to them. Down the steps he went and
          into a wide, empty hall that had doorways to the right hand and to
          the left hand. Here the thread had its end. It was fastened to a
          cone that lay on the ground, and beside this cone was another—the
          clue that was to bring him back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now Theseus,
          knowing he was in the very center of the labyrinth, looked all
          around for sight of the Minotaur. There was no sight of the monster
          here. He went to all the doors and pushed at them, and some opened
          and some remained fast. The middle door opened. As it did Theseus
          felt around him a chilling draft of air.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That chilling
          draft was from the breathing of the monster. Theseus then saw the
          Minotaur. It lay on the ground, a strange, bull-faced thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the
          thought came to Theseus that he would have to fight that monster
          alone and in that hidden and empty place all delight left him; he
          grew like a stone; he groaned, and it seemed to him that he heard
          the voice of Ariadne calling him back. He could find his way back
          through the labyrinth and come to her. He stepped back, and the
          door closed on the Minotaur, the dread monster of Crete.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In an instant
          Theseus pushed the door again. He stood within the hall where the
          Minotaur was, and the heavy door <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page215">[pg 215]</span> shut behind him. He looked again on that
          dark, bull-faced thing. It reared up as a horse rears and Theseus
          saw that it would crash down on him and tear him with its dragon
          claws. With a great bound he went far away from where the monster
          crashed down. Then Theseus faced it: he saw its thick lips and its
          slobbering mouth; he saw that its skin was thick and hard.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He drew near
          the monster, his sword in his hand. He struck at its eyes, and his
          sword made a great dint. But no blood came, for the Minotaur was a
          bloodless monster. From its mouth and nostrils came a draft that
          covered him with a chilling slime.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then it rushed
          upon him and overthrew him, and Theseus felt its terrible weight
          upon him. But he thrust his sword upward, and it reared up again,
          screaming with pain. Theseus drew himself away, and then he saw it
          searching around and around, and he knew he had made it sightless.
          Then it faced him; all the more fearful it was because from its
          wounds no blood came.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Anger flowed
          into Theseus when he saw the monster standing frightfully before
          him; he thought of all the youths and maidens that this bloodless
          thing had destroyed, and all the youths and maidens that it would
          destroy if he did not slay it now. Angrily he rushed upon it with
          his great sword. It clawed and tore him, and it opened wide its
          most evil mouth as if to draw him into it. But again he sprang at
          it; he thrust his great sword through its neck, and he left his
          sword there. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg
          216]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> With the last
          of his strength he pulled open the heavy door and he went out from
          the hall where the Minotaur was. He picked up the thread and he
          began to wind it as he had wound the other thread on his way down.
          On he went, through passage after passage, through chamber after
          chamber. His mind was dizzy, and he had little thought for the way
          he was going. His wounds and the chill that the monster had
          breathed into him and his horror of the fearful and bloodless thing
          made his mind almost forsake him. He kept the thread in his hand
          and he wound it as he went on through the labyrinth. He stumbled
          and the thread broke. He went on for a few steps and then he went
          back to find the thread that had fallen out of his hands. In an
          instant he was in a part of the labyrinth that he had not been in
          before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He walked a
          long way, and then he came on his own footmarks as they crossed
          themselves in the dust. He pushed open a door and came into the
          air. He was now by the outside wall of the palace, and he saw birds
          flying by him. He leant against the wall of the palace, thinking
          that he would strive no more to find his way through the
          labyrinth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That day the
          youths and maidens of Athens were brought through the labyrinth and
          to the hall where the Minotaur was. They went through the passages
          weeping and lamenting. Some cried out for Theseus, and some said
          that Theseus had deserted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
          217]</span> them. The heavy door was opened. Then those who were
          with the youths and maidens saw the Minotaur lying stark and stiff
          with Theseus’s sword through its neck. They shouted and blew
          trumpets and the noise of their trumpets filled the labyrinth. Then
          they turned back, bringing the youths and maidens with them, and a
          whisper went through the whole palace that the Minotaur had been
          slain. The youths and maidens were lodged in the chamber where
          Minos gave his judgments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus,
          wearied and overcome, fell into a deep sleep by the wall of the
          palace. He awakened with a feeling that the claw of the Minotaur
          was upon him. There were stars in the sky above the high palace
          wall, and he saw a dark-robed and ancient man standing beside him.
          Theseus knew that this was Dædalus, the builder of the palace and
          the labyrinth. Dædalus called and a slim youth came—Icarus, the son
          of Dædalus. Minos had set father and son apart from the rest of the
          palace, and Theseus had come near the place where they were
          confined. Icarus came and brought him to a winding stairway and
          showed him a way to go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A dark-faced
          servant met and looked him full in the face. Then, as if he knew
          that Theseus was the one whom he had been searching for, he led him
          into a little chamber where there were three maidens. One started
          up and came to him quickly, and Theseus again saw Ariadne.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She hid him in
          the chamber of the palace where her singing birds were, and she
          would come and sit beside him, asking about his own country and
          telling him that she would go with him there. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I showed you how you might come to the
          Minotaur,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and you went
          there and you slew the monster, and now I may not stay in my
          father’s palace.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Theseus
          thought all the time of his return, and of how he might bring the
          youths and maidens of Athens back to their own people. For Ariadne,
          that strange princess, was not dear to him as Medea was dear to
          Jason, or Atalanta the Huntress to young Meleagrus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One sunset she
          led him to a roof of the palace and she showed him the harbor with
          the ships, and she showed him the ship with the black sail that had
          brought him to Knossos. She told him she would take him aboard that
          ship, and that the youths and maidens of Athens could go with them.
          She would bring to the master of the ship the seal of King Minos,
          and the master, seeing it, would set sail for whatever place
          Theseus desired to go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then did she
          become dear to Theseus because of her great kindness, and he kissed
          her eyes and swore that he would not go from the palace unless she
          would come with him to his own country. The strange princess smiled
          and wept as if she doubted what he said. Nevertheless, she led him
          from the roof and down into one of the palace gardens. He waited
          there, and the youths and maidens of Athens were led into the
          garden, all wearing cloaks that hid their forms and faces. Young
          Icarus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span> led
          them from the grounds of the palace and down to the ships. And
          Ariadne went with them, bringing with her the seal of her father,
          King Minos.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And when they
          came on board of the black-sailed ship they showed the seal to the
          master, Nausitheus, and the master of the ship let the sail take
          the breeze of the evening, and so Theseus went away from Crete.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.20em"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> To the Island
          of Naxos they sailed. And when they reached that place the master
          of the ship, thinking that what had been done was not in accordance
          with the will of King Minos, stayed the ship there. He waited until
          other ships came from Knossos. And when they came they brought word
          that Minos would not slay nor demand back Theseus nor the youths
          and maidens of Athens. His daughter, Ariadne, he would have back,
          to reign with him over Crete.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Ariadne
          left the black-sailed ship, and went back to Crete from Naxos.
          Theseus let the princess go, although he might have struggled to
          hold her. But more strange than dear did Ariadne remain to
          Theseus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And all this
          time his father, Ægeus, stayed on the tower of his palace, watching
          for the return of the ship that had sailed for Knossos. The life of
          the king wasted since the departure of Theseus, and now it was but
          a thread. Every day he watched for the return of the ship, hoping
          against hope that Theseus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
          220]</span> would return alive to him. Then a ship came into the
          harbor. It had black sails. Ægeus did not know that Theseus was
          aboard of it, and that Theseus in the hurry of his flight and in
          the sadness of his parting from Ariadne had not thought of taking
          out the white sail that his father had given to Nausitheus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Joyously
          Theseus sailed into the harbor, having slain the Minotaur and
          lifted for ever the tribute put upon Athens. Joyously he sailed
          into the harbor, bringing back to their parents the youths and
          maidens of Athens. But the king, his father, saw the black sails on
          his ship, and straightway the thread of his life broke, and he died
          on the roof of the tower which he had built to look out on the
          sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Theseus landed
          on the shore of his own country. He had the ship drawn up on the
          beach and he made sacrifices of thanksgiving to the gods. Then he
          sent messengers to the city to announce his return. They went
          toward the city, these joyful messengers, but when they came to the
          gate they heard the sounds of mourning and lamentation. The
          mourning and the lamentation were for the death of the king,
          Theseus’s father. They hurried back and they came to Theseus where
          he stood on the beach. They brought a wreath of victory for him,
          but as they put it into his hand they told him of the death of his
          father. Then Theseus left the wreath on the ground, and he wept for
          the death of Ægeus—of Ægeus, the hero, who had left the sword under
          the stone for him before he was born.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The men and
          women who came to the beach wept and laughed <span class=

          arms the children brought back to them. And Theseus stood there,
          silent and bowed; the memory of his last moments with his father,
          of his fight with the Minotaur, of his parting with Ariadne—all
          flowed back upon him. He stood there with head bowed, the man who
          might not put upon his brows the wreath of victory that had been
          brought to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There had come
          into the city a youth of great valor whose name was Peirithous:
          from a far country he had come, filled with a desire of meeting
          Theseus, whose fame had come to him. The youth was in Athens at the
          time Theseus returned. He went down to the beach with the
          townsfolk, and he saw Theseus standing alone with his head bowed
          down. He went to him and he spoke, and Theseus lifted his head and
          he saw before him a young man of strength and beauty. He looked
          upon him, and the thought of high deeds came into his mind again.
          He wanted this young man to be his comrade in dangers and upon
          quests. And Peirithous looked upon Theseus, and he felt that he was
          greater and nobler than he had thought. They became friends and
          sworn brothers, and together they went into far countries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now there was
          in Epirus a savage king who had a very fair daughter. He had named
          this daughter Persephone, naming her thus to show that she was held
          as fast by him as that other Persephone was held who ruled in the
          Underworld. No man might <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
          222]</span> see her, and no man might wed her. But Peirithous had
          seen the daughter of this king, and he desired above all things to
          take her from her father and make her his wife. He begged Theseus
          to help him enter that king’s palace and carry off the maiden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So they came to
          Epirus, Theseus and Peirithous, and they entered the king’s palace,
          and they heard the bay of the dread hound that was there to let no
          one out who had once come within the walls. Suddenly the guards of
          the savage king came upon them, and they took Theseus and
          Peirithous and they dragged them down into dark dungeons.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Two great
          chairs of stone were there, and Theseus and Peirithous were left
          seated in them. And the magic powers that were in the chairs of
          stone were such that the heroes could not lift themselves out of
          them. There they stayed, held in the great stone chairs in the
          dungeons of that savage king.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then it so
          happened that Heracles came into the palace of the king. The harsh
          king feasted Heracles and abated his savagery before him. But he
          could not forbear boasting of how he had trapped the heroes who had
          come to carry off Persephone. And he told how they could not get
          out of the stone chairs and how they were held captive in his dark
          dungeon. Heracles listened, his heart full of pity for the heroes
          from Greece who had met with such a harsh fate. And when the king
          mentioned that one of the heroes was Theseus, Heracles would feast
          no more with him until he had promised that the one who had been
          his comrade on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> would be let go. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king said
          he would give Theseus his liberty if Heracles would carry the stone
          chair on which he was seated out of the dungeon and into the outer
          world. Then Heracles went down into the dungeon. He found the two
          heroes in the great chairs of stone. But one of them, Peirithous,
          no longer breathed. Heracles took the great chair of stone that
          Theseus was seated in, and he carried it up, up, from the dungeon
          and out into the world. It was a heavy task even for Heracles. He
          broke the chair in pieces, and Theseus stood up, released.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Thereafter the
          world was before Theseus. He went with Heracles, and in the deeds

          the son of Zeus, but he was born into the family of a mortal king.
          When he was still a youth, being overwhelmed by a madness sent upon
          him by one of the goddesses, he slew the children of his brother
          Iphicles. Then, coming to know what he had done, sleep and rest
          went from him: he went to Delphi, to the shrine of Apollo, to be
          purified of his crime.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> At Delphi, at
          the shrine of Apollo, the priestess purified him, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span> and when she had purified
          him she uttered this prophecy: <span class="tei tei-q">“From this
          day forth thy name shall be, not Alcides, but Heracles. Thou shalt
          go to Eurystheus, thy cousin, in Mycenæ, and serve him in all
          things. When the labors he shall lay upon thee are accomplished,
          and when the rest of thy life is lived out, thou shalt become one
          of the immortals.”</span> Heracles, on hearing these words, set out
          for Mycenæ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He stood before
          his cousin who hated him; he, a towering man, stood before a king
          who sat there weak and trembling. And Heracles said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have come to take up the labors that you will lay
          upon me; speak now, Eurystheus, and tell me what you would have me
          do.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Eurystheus,
          that weak king, looking on the young man who stood as tall and as
          firm as one of the immortals, had a heart that was filled with
          hatred. He lifted up his head and he said with a frown:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is a lion in Nemea that is stronger and more
          fierce than any lion known before. Kill that lion, and bring the
          lion’s skin to me that I may know that you have truly performed
          your task.”</span> So Eurystheus said, and Heracles, with neither
          shield nor arms, went forth from the king’s palace to seek and to
          combat the dread lion of Nemea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He went on
          until he came into a country where the fences were overthrown and
          the fields wasted and the houses empty and fallen. He went on until
          he came to the waste around that land: there he came on the trail
          of the lion; it led up the side <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page225">[pg 225]</span> of a mountain, and Heracles, without
          shield or arms, followed the trail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He heard the
          roar of the lion. Looking up he saw the beast standing at the mouth
          of a cavern, huge and dark against the sunset. The lion roared
          three times, and then it went within the cavern.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Around the
          mouth were strewn the bones of creatures it had killed and carried
          there. Heracles looked upon them when he came to the cavern. He
          went within. Far into the cavern he went, and then he came to where
          he saw the lion. It was sleeping.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles viewed
          the terrible bulk of the lion, and then he looked upon his own
          knotted hands and arms. He remembered that it was told of him that,
          while still a child of eight months, he had strangled a great
          serpent that had come to his cradle to devour him. He had grown and
          his strength had grown too.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So he stood,
          measuring his strength and the size of the lion. The breath from
          its mouth and nostrils came heavily to him as the beast slept,
          gorged with its prey. Then the lion yawned. Heracles sprang on it
          and put his great hands upon its throat. No growl came out of its
          mouth, but the great eyes blazed while the terrible paws tore at
          Heracles. Against the rock Heracles held the beast; strongly he
          held it, choking it through the skin that was almost impenetrable.
          Terribly the lion struggled; but the strong hands of the hero held
          around its throat until it struggled no more. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
          stripped off that impenetrable skin from the lion’s body; he put it
          upon himself for a cloak. Then, as he went through the forest, he
          pulled up a young oak tree and trimmed it and made a club for
          himself. With the lion’s skin over him—that skin that no spear or
          arrow could pierce—and carrying the club in his hand he journeyed
          on until he came to the palace of King Eurystheus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king,
          seeing coming toward him a towering man all covered with the hide
          of a monstrous lion, ran and hid himself in a great jar. He lifted
          the lid up to ask the servants what was the meaning of this
          terrible appearance. And the servants told him that it was Heracles
          come back with the skin of the lion of Nemea. On hearing this
          Eurystheus hid himself again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He would not
          speak with Heracles nor have him come near him, so fearful was he.
          But Heracles was content to be left alone. He sat down in the
          palace and feasted himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The servants
          came to the king; Eurystheus lifted the lid of the jar and they
          told him how Heracles was feasting and devouring all the goods in
          the palace. The king flew into a rage, but still he was fearful of
          having the hero before him. He issued commands through his heralds
          ordering Heracles to go forth at once and perform the second of his
          tasks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was to slay
          the great water snake that made its lair in the swamps of Lerna.
          Heracles stayed to feast another day, and then, with the lion’s
          skin across his shoulders and the great <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page227">[pg 227]</span> club in his hands, he started off. But
          this time he did not go alone; the boy Iolaus went with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles and
          Iolaus went on until they came to the vast swamp of Lerna. Right in
          the middle of the swamp was the water snake that was called the
          Hydra. Nine heads it had, and it raised them up out of the water as
          the hero and his companion came near. They could not cross the
          swamp to come to the monster, for man or beast would sink and be
          lost in it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Hydra
          remained in the middle of the swamp belching mud at the hero and
          his companion. Then Heracles took up his bow and he shot flaming
          arrows at its heads. It grew into such a rage that it came through
          the swamp to attack him. Heracles swung his club. As the Hydra came
          near he knocked head after head off its body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But for every
          head knocked off two grew upon the Hydra. And as he struggled with
          the monster a huge crab came out of the swamp, and gripping
          Heracles by the foot tried to draw him in. Then Heracles cried out.
          The boy Iolaus came; he killed the crab that had come to the
          Hydra’s aid.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
          laid hands upon the Hydra and drew it out of the swamp. With his
          club he knocked off a head and he had Iolaus put fire to where it
          had been, so that two heads might not grow in that place. The life
          of the Hydra was in its middle head; that head he had not been able
          to knock off with his club. Now, with his hands he tore it off, and
          he placed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span>
          this head under a great stone so that it could not rise into life
          again. The Hydra’s life was now destroyed. Heracles dipped his
          arrows into the gall of the monster, making his arrows deadly; no
          thing that was struck by these arrows afterward could keep its
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Again he came
          to Eurystheus’s palace, and Eurystheus, seeing him, ran again and
          hid himself in the jar. Heracles ordered the servants to tell the
          king that he had returned and that the second labor was
          accomplished.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Eurystheus,
          hearing from the servants that Heracles was mild in his ways, came
          out of the jar. Insolently he spoke. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Twelve labors you have to accomplish for me,”</span>
          said he to Heracles, <span class="tei tei-q">“and eleven yet remain
          to be accomplished.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How?”</span> said Heracles. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Have I not performed two of the labors? Have I not
          slain the lion of Nemea and the great water snake of
          Lerna?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the killing of the water snake you were helped by
          Iolaus,”</span> said the king, snapping out his words and looking
          at Heracles with shifting eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“That labor
          cannot be allowed you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles would
          have struck him to the ground. But then he remembered that the
          crime that he had committed in his madness would have to be
          expiated by labors performed at the order of this man. He looked
          full upon Eurystheus and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me
          of the other labors, and I will go forth from Mycenæ and accomplish
          them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Eurystheus
          bade him go and make clean the stables of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page229">[pg 229]</span> King Augeias. Heracles came into that
          king’s country. The smell from the stables was felt for miles
          around. Countless herds of cattle and goats had been in the stables
          for years, and because of the uncleanness and the smell that came
          from it the crops were withered all around. Heracles told the king
          that he would clean the stables if he were given one tenth of the
          cattle and the goats for a reward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king agreed
          to this reward. Then Heracles drove the cattle and the goats out of
          the stables; he broke through the foundations and he made channels
          for the two rivers Alpheus and Peneius. The waters flowed through
          the stables, and in a day all the uncleanness was washed away. Then
          Heracles turned the rivers back into their own courses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He was not
          given the reward he had bargained for, however.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He went back to
          Mycenæ with the tale of how he had cleaned the stables.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Ten labors remain for me to do
          now,”</span> he said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eleven,”</span> said Eurystheus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How can I allow the cleaning of King Augeias’s stables
          to you when you bargained for a reward for doing it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then while
          Heracles stood still, holding himself back from striking him,
          Eurystheus ran away and hid himself in the jar. Through his heralds
          he sent word to Heracles, telling him what the other labors would
          be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He was to clear
          the marshes of Stymphalus of the man-eating birds that gathered
          there; he was to capture and bring <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page230">[pg 230]</span> to the king the golden-horned deer of
          Coryneia; he was also to capture and bring alive to Mycenæ the boar
          of Erymanthus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles came
          to the marshes of Stymphalus. The growth of jungle was so dense
          that he could not cut his way through to where the man-eating birds
          were; they sat upon low bushes within the jungle, gorging
          themselves upon the flesh they had carried there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> For days
          Heracles tried to hack his way through. He could not get to where
          the birds were. Then, thinking he might not be able to accomplish
          this labor, he sat upon the ground in despair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
          that one of the immortals appeared to him; for the first and only
          time he was given help from the gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was Athena
          who came to him. She stood apart from Heracles, holding in her
          hands brazen cymbals. These she clashed together. At the sound of
          this clashing the Stymphalean birds rose up from the low bushes
          behind the jungle. Heracles shot at them with those unerring arrows
          of his. The man-eating birds fell, one after the other, into the
          marsh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
          went north to where the Coryneian deer took her pasture. So swift
          of foot was she that no hound nor hunter had ever been able to
          overtake her. For the whole of a year Heracles kept Golden Horns in
          chase, and at last, on the side of the Mountain Artemision, he
          caught her. Artemis, the goddess of the wild things, would have
          punished Heracles for capturing the deer, but the hero pleaded with
          her, and she relented and agreed to let him bring the deer to
          Mycenæ and show her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
          231]</span> to King Eurystheus. And Artemis took charge of Golden
          Horns while Heracles went off to capture the Erymanthean boar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He came to the
          city of Psophis, the inhabitants of which were in deadly fear
          because of the ravages of the boar. Heracles made his way up the
          mountain to hunt it. Now on this mountain a band of centaurs lived,
          and they, knowing him since the time he had been fostered by
          Chiron, welcomed Heracles. One of them, Pholus, took Heracles to
          the great house where the centaurs had their wine stored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Seldom did the
          centaurs drink wine; a draft of it made them wild, and so they
          stored it away, leaving it in the charge of one of their band.
          Heracles begged Pholus to give him a draft of wine; after he had
          begged again and again the centaur opened one of his great
          jars.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles drank
          wine and spilled it. Then the centaurs that were without smelt the
          wine and came hammering at the door, demanding the drafts that
          would make them wild. Heracles came forth to drive them away. They
          attacked him. Then he shot at them with his unerring arrows and he
          drove them away. Up the mountain and away to far rivers the
          centaurs raced, pursued by Heracles with his bow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One was slain,
          Pholus, the centaur who had entertained him. By accident Heracles
          dropped a poisoned arrow on his foot. He took the body of Pholus up
          to the top of the mountain and buried the centaur there. Afterward,
          on the snows of Erymanthus, he set a snare for the boar and caught
          him there. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
          232]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Upon his
          shoulders he carried the boar to Mycenæ and he led the deer by her
          golden horns. When Eurystheus had looked upon them the boar was
          slain, but the deer was loosed and she fled back to the Mountain
          Artemision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> King Eurystheus
          sat hidden in the great jar, and he thought of more terrible labors
          he would make Heracles engage in. Now he would send him oversea and
          make him strive with fierce tribes and more dread monsters. When he
          had it all thought out he had Heracles brought before him and he
          told him of these other labors.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He was to go to
          savage Thrace and there destroy the man-eating horses of King
          Diomedes; afterward he was to go amongst the dread women, the
          Amazons, daughters of Ares, the god of war, and take from their
          queen, Hippolyte, the girdle that Ares had given her; then he was
          to go to Crete and take from the keeping of King Minos the
          beautiful bull that Poseidon had given him; afterward he was to go
          to the Island of Erytheia and take away from Geryoneus, the monster
          that had three bodies instead of one, the herd of red cattle that
          the two-headed hound Orthus kept guard over; then he was to go to
          the Garden of the Hesperides, and from that garden he was to take
          the golden apples that Zeus had given to Hera for a marriage
          gift—where the Garden of the Hesperides was no mortal knew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Heracles set
          out on a long and perilous quest. First he went to Thrace, that
          savage land that was ruled over by Diomedes, son of Ares, the war
          god. Heracles broke into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page233">[pg 233]</span> stable where the horses were; he caught
          three of them by their heads, and although they kicked and bit and
          trampled he forced them out of the stable and down to the seashore,
          where his companion, Abderus, waited for him. The screams of the
          fierce horses were heard by the men of Thrace, and they, with their
          king, came after Heracles. He left the horses in charge of Abderus
          while he fought the Thracians and their savage king. Heracles shot
          his deadly arrows amongst them, and then he fought with their king.
          He drove them from the seashore, and then he came back to where he
          had left Abderus with the fierce horses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They had thrown
          Abderus upon the ground, and they were trampling upon him. Heracles
          drew his bow and he shot the horses with the unerring arrows that
          were dipped with the gall of the Hydra he had slain. Screaming, the
          horses of King Diomedes raced toward the sea, but one fell and
          another fell, and then, as it came to the line of the foam, the
          third of the fierce horses fell. They were all slain with the
          unerring arrows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
          took up the body of his companion and he buried it with proper
          rights, and over it he raised a column. Afterward, around that
          column a city that bore the name of Heracles’s friend was
          built.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then toward the
          Euxine Sea he went. There, where the River Themiscyra flows into
          the sea he saw the abodes of the Amazons. And upon the rocks and
          the steep place he saw the warrior women standing with drawn bows
          in their hands. Most dangerous <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page234">[pg 234]</span> did they seem to Heracles. He did not
          know how to approach them; he might shoot at them with his unerring
          arrows, but when his arrows were all shot away, the Amazons, from
          their steep places, might be able to kill him with the arrows from
          their bows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> While he stood
          at a distance, wondering what he might do, a horn was sounded and
          an Amazon mounted upon a white stallion rode toward him. When the
          warrior-woman came near she cried out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Heracles, the Queen Hippolyte permits you to come
          amongst the Amazons. Enter her tent and declare to the queen what
          has brought you amongst the never-conquered Amazons.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles came
          to the tent of the queen. There stood tall Hippolyte with an iron
          crown upon her head and with a beautiful girdle of bronze and
          iridescent glass around her waist. Proud and fierce as a mountain
          eagle looked the queen of the Amazons: Heracles did not know in
          what way he might conquer her. Outside the tent the Amazons stood;
          they struck their shields with their spears, keeping up a
          continuous savage din.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For what has Heracles come to the country of the
          Amazons?”</span> Queen Hippolyte asked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For the girdle you wear,”</span> said Heracles, and he
          held his hands ready for the struggle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is it for the girdle given me by Ares, the god of war,
          that you have come, braving the Amazons, Heracles?”</span> asked
          the queen. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
          235]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For that,”</span> said Heracles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would not have you enter into strife with the
          Amazons,”</span> said Queen Hippolyte. And so saying she drew off
          the girdle of bronze and iridescent glass, and she gave it into his
          hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles took
          the beautiful girdle into his hands. Fearful he was that some piece
          of guile was being played upon him, but then he looked into the
          open eyes of the queen and he saw that she meant no guile. He took
          the girdle and he put it around his great brows; then he thanked
          Hippolyte and he went from the tent. He saw the Amazons standing on
          the rocks and the steep places with bows bent; unchallenged he went
          on, and he came to his ship and he sailed away from that country
          with one more labor accomplished.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The labor that
          followed was not dangerous. He sailed over sea and he came to
          Crete, to the land that King Minos ruled over. And there he found,
          grazing in a special pasture, the bull that Poseidon had given King
          Minos. He laid his hands upon the bull’s horns and he struggled
          with him and he overthrew him. Then he drove the bull down to the
          seashore.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> His next labor
          was to take away the herd of red cattle that was owned by the
          monster Geryoneus. In the Island of Erytheia, in the middle of the
          Stream of Ocean, lived the monster, his herd guarded by the
          two-headed hound Orthus—that hound was the brother of Cerberus, the
          three-headed hound that kept guard in the Underworld.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Mounted upon
          the bull given Minos by Poseidon, Heracles <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page236">[pg 236]</span> fared across the sea. He came even to
          the straits that divide Europe from Africa, and there he set up two
          pillars as a memorial of his journey—the Pillars of Heracles that
          stand to this day. He and the bull rested there. Beyond him
          stretched the Stream of Ocean; the Island of Erytheia was there,
          but Heracles thought that the bull would not be able to bear him so
          far.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And there the
          sun beat upon him, and drew all strength away from him, and he was
          dazed and dazzled by the rays of the sun. He shouted out against
          the sun, and in his anger he wanted to strive against the sun. Then
          he drew his bow and shot arrows upward. Far, far out of sight the
          arrows of Heracles went. And the sun god, Helios, was filled with
          admiration for Heracles, the man who would attempt the impossible
          by shooting arrows at him; then did Helios fling down to Heracles
          his great golden cup.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Down, and into
          the Stream of Ocean fell the great golden cup of Helios. It floated
          there wide enough to hold all the men who might be in a ship.
          Heracles put the bull of Minos into the cup of Helios, and the cup
          bore them away, toward the west, and across the Stream of
          Ocean.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Thus Heracles
          came to the Island of Erytheia. All over the island straggled the
          red cattle of Geryoneus, grazing upon the rich pastures. Heracles,
          leaving the bull of Minos in the cup, went upon the island; he made
          a club for himself out of a tree and he went toward the cattle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The hound
          Orthus bayed and ran toward him; the two-headed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span> hound that was the
          brother of Cerberus sprang at Heracles with poisonous foam upon his
          jaws. Heracles swung his club and struck the two heads off the
          hound. And where the foam of the hound’s jaws dropped down a
          poisonous plant sprang up. Heracles took up the body of the hound,
          and swung it around and flung it far out into the Ocean.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the
          monster Geryoneus came upon him. Three bodies he had instead of
          one; he attacked Heracles by hurling great stones at him. Heracles
          was hurt by the stones. And then the monster beheld the cup of
          Helios, and he began to hurl stones at the golden thing, and it
          seemed that he might sink it in the sea, and leave Heracles without
          a way of getting from the island. Heracles took up his bow and he
          shot arrow after arrow at the monster, and he left him dead in the
          deep grass of the pastures.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then he rounded
          up the red cattle, the bulls and the cows, and he drove them down
          to the shore and into the golden cup of Helios where the bull of
          Minos stayed. Then back across the Stream of Ocean the cup floated,
          and the bull of Crete and the cattle of Geryoneus were brought past
          Sicily and through the straits called the Hellespont. To Thrace,
          that savage land, they came. Then Heracles took the cattle out, and
          the cup of Helios sank in the sea. Through the wild lands of Thrace
          he drove the herd of Geryoneus and the bull of Minos, and he came
          into Mycenæ once more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But he did not
          stay to speak with Eurystheus. He started off to find the Garden of
          the Hesperides, the Daughters of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page238">[pg 238]</span> Evening Land. Long did he search, but he
          found no one who could tell him where the garden was. And at last
          he went to Chiron on the Mountain Pelion, and Chiron told Heracles
          what journey he would have to make to come to the Hesperides, the
          Daughters of the Evening Land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Far did
          Heracles journey; weary he was when he came to where Atlas stood,
          bearing the sky upon his weary shoulders. As he came near he felt
          an undreamt-of perfume being wafted toward him. So weary was he
          with his journey and all his toils that he would fain sink down and
          dream away in that evening land. But he roused himself, and he
          journeyed on toward where the perfume came from. Over that place a
          star seemed always about to rise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He came to
          where a silver lattice fenced a garden that was full of the quiet
          of evening. Golden bees hummed through the air, and there was the
          sound of quiet waters. How wild and laborious was the world he had
          come from, Heracles thought! He felt that it would be hard for him
          to return to that world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He saw three
          maidens. They stood with wreaths upon their heads and blossoming
          branches in their hands. When the maidens saw him they came toward
          him crying out: <span class="tei tei-q">“O man who has come into
          the Garden of the Hesperides, go not near the tree that the
          sleepless dragon guards!”</span> Then they went and stood by a tree
          as if to keep guard over it. All around were trees that bore
          flowers and fruit, but this tree had golden apples amongst its
          bright green leaves. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
          239]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then he saw the
          guardian of the tree. Beside its trunk a dragon lay, and as
          Heracles came near the dragon showed its glittering scales and its
          deadly claws.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The apples were
          within reach, but the dragon, with its glittering scales and claws,
          stood in the way. Heracles shot an arrow; then a tremor went
          through Ladon, the sleepless dragon; it screamed and then lay
          stark. The maidens cried in their grief; Heracles went to the tree,
          and he plucked the golden apples and he put them into the pouch he
          carried. Down on the ground sank the Hesperides, the Daughters of
          the Evening Land, and he heard their laments as he went from the
          enchanted garden they had guarded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Back from the
          ends of the earth came Heracles, back from the place where Atlas
          stood holding the sky upon his weary shoulders. He went back
          through Asia and Libya and Egypt, and he came again to Mycenæ and
          to the palace of Eurystheus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He brought to
          the king the herd of Geryoneus; he brought to the king the bull of
          Minos; he brought to the king the girdle of Hippolyte; he brought
          to the king the golden apples of the Hesperides. And King
          Eurystheus, with his thin white face, sat upon his royal throne and
          he looked over all the wonderful things that the hero had brought
          him. Not pleased was Eurystheus; rather was he angry that one he
          hated could win such wonderful things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He took into
          his hands the golden apples of the Hesperides. But this fruit was
          not for such as he. An eagle snatched the <span class="tei tei-pb"

          flew and flew until it came to where the Daughters of the Evening
          Land wept in their garden. There the eagle let fall the branch with
          the golden apples, and the maidens set it back upon the tree, and
          behold! it grew as it had been growing before Heracles plucked
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The next day
          the heralds of Eurystheus came to Heracles and they told him of the
          last labor that he would have to set out to accomplish—this time he
          would have to go down into the Underworld, and bring up from King
          Aidoneus’s realm Cerberus, the three-headed hound.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles put
          upon him the impenetrable lion’s skin and set forth once more. This
          might indeed be the last of his life’s labors: Cerberus was not an
          earthly monster, and he who would struggle with Cerberus in the
          Underworld would have the gods of the dead against him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Heracles
          went on. He journeyed to the cave Tainaron, which was an entrance
          to the Underworld. Far into that dismal cave he went, and then
          down, down, until he came to Acheron, that dim river that has
          beyond it only the people of the dead. Cerberus bayed at him from
          the place where the dead cross the river. Knowing that he was no
          shade, the hound sprang at Heracles, but he could neither bite nor
          tear through that impenetrable lion’s skin. Heracles held him by
          the neck of his middle head so that Cerberus was neither able to
          bite nor tear nor bellow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then to the
          brink of Acheron came Persephone, queen of the <span class=

          to Heracles that the gods of the dead would not strive against him
          if he promised to bring Cerberus back to the Underworld, carrying
          the hound downward again as he carried him upward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> This Heracles
          promised. He turned around and he carried Cerberus, his hands
          around the monster’s neck while foam dripped from his jaws. He
          carried him on and upward toward the world of men. Out through a
          cave that was in the land of Trœzen Heracles came, still carrying
          Cerberus by the neck of his middle head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> From Trœzen to
          Mycenæ the hero went and men fled before him at the sight of the
          monster that he carried. On he went toward the king’s palace.
          Eurystheus was seated outside his palace that day, looking at the
          great jar that he had often hidden in, and thinking to himself that
          Heracles would never appear to affright him again. Then Heracles
          appeared. He called to Eurystheus, and when the king looked up he
          held the hound toward him. The three heads grinned at Eurystheus;
          he gave a cry and scrambled into the jar. But before his feet
          touched the bottom of it Eurystheus was dead of fear. The jar
          rolled over, and Heracles looked upon the body that was all twisted
          with fright. Then he turned around and made his way back to the
          Underworld. On the brink of Acheron he loosed Cerberus, and the
          bellow of the three-headed hound was heard again.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.20em"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
          that Heracles was given arms by the gods—the sword of Hermes, the
          bow of Apollo, the shield made by Hephæstus; it was then that
          Heracles joined the Argonauts and journeyed with them to the edge
          of the Caucasus, where, slaying the vulture that preyed upon
          Prometheus’s liver, he, at the will of Zeus, liberated the Titan.
          Thereafter Zeus and Prometheus were reconciled, and Zeus, that
          neither might forget how much the enmity between them had cost gods
          and men, had a ring made for Prometheus to wear; that ring was made
          out of the fetter that had been upon him, and in it was set a
          fragment of the rock that the Titan had been bound to.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The Argonauts
          had now won back to Greece. But before he saw any of them he had
          been in Oichalia, and had seen the maiden Iole.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king of
          Oichalia had offered his daughter Iole in marriage to the hero who
          could excel himself and his sons in shooting with arrows. Heracles
          saw Iole, the blue-eyed and childlike maiden, and he longed to take
          her with him to some place near the Garden of the Hesperides. And
          Iole looked on him, and he knew that she wondered to see him so
          tall and so strongly knit even as he wondered to see her so
          childlike and delicate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the
          contest began. The king and his sons shot wonderfully well, and
          none of the heroes who stood before Heracles had a chance of
          winning. Then Heracles shot his arrows. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page243">[pg 243]</span> No matter how far away they moved the
          mark, Heracles struck it and struck the very center of it. The
          people wondered who this great archer might be. And then a name was
          guessed at and went around—Heracles!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the king
          heard the name of Heracles he would not let him strive in the
          contest any more. For the maiden Iole would not be given as a prize
          to one who had been mad and whose madness might afflict him again.
          So the king said, speaking in judgment in the market place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Rage came on
          Heracles when he heard this judgment given. He would not let his
          rage master him lest the madness that was spoken of should come
          with his rage. So he left the city of Oichalia declaring to the
          king and the people that he would return.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
          that, wandering down to Crete, he heard of the Argonauts being
          near. And afterward he heard of them being in Calydon, hunting the
          boar that ravaged Œneus’s country. To Calydon Heracles went. The
          heroes had departed when he came into the country, and all the city
          was in grief for the deaths of Prince Meleagrus and his two
          uncles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On the steps of
          the temple where Meleagrus and his uncles had been brought Heracles
          saw Deianira, Meleagrus’s sister. She was pale with her grief, this
          tall woman of the mountains; she looked like a priestess, but also
          like a woman who could cheer camps of men with her counsel, her
          bravery, and her good companionship; her hair was very dark and she
          had dark eyes. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg
          244]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Straightway she
          became friends with Heracles; and when they saw each other for a
          while they loved each other. And Heracles forgot Iole, the
          childlike maiden whom he had seen in Oichalia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He made himself
          a suitor for Deianira, and those who protected her were glad of
          Heracles’s suit, and they told him they would give him the maiden
          to marry as soon as the mourning for Prince Meleagrus and his
          uncles was over. Heracles stayed in Calydon, happy with Deianira,
          who had so much beauty, wisdom, and bravery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But then a
          dreadful thing happened in Calydon; by an accident, while using his
          strength unthinkingly, Heracles killed a lad who was related to
          Deianira. He might not marry her now until he had taken punishment
          for slaying one who was close to her in blood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As a punishment
          for the slaying it was judged that Heracles should be sold into
          slavery for three years. At the end of his three years’ slavery he
          could come back to Calydon and wed Deianira.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And so Heracles
          and Deianira were parted. He was sold as a slave in Lydia; the one
          who bought him was a woman, a widow named Omphale. To her house
          Heracles went, carrying his armor and wearing his lion’s skin. And
          Omphale laughed to see this tall man dressed in a lion’s skin
          coming to her house to do a servant’s tasks for her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She and all in
          her house kept up fun with Heracles. They <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page245">[pg 245]</span> would set him to do housework, to
          carry water, and set vessels on the tables, and clear the vessels
          away. Omphale set him to spin with a spindle as the women did. And
          often she would put on Heracles’s lion skin and go about dragging
          his club, while he, dressed in woman’s garb, washed dishes and
          emptied pots.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But he would
          lose patience with these servant’s tasks, and then Omphale would
          let him go away and perform some great exploit. Often he went on
          long journeys and stayed away for long times. It was while he was
          in slavery to Omphale that he liberated Theseus from the dungeon in
          which he was held with Peirithous, and it was while he still was in
          slavery that he made his journey to Troy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> At Troy he
          helped to repair for King Laomedon the great walls that years
          before Apollo and Poseidon had built around the city. As a reward
          for this labor he was offered the Princess Hesione in marriage; she
          was the daughter of King Laomedon, and the sister of Priam, who was
          then called, not Priam but Podarces. He helped to repair the wall,
          and two of the Argonauts were there to aid him: one was Peleus and
          the other was Telamon. Peleus did not stay for long: Telamon
          stayed, and to reward Telamon Heracles withdrew his own claim for
          the hand of the Princess Hesione. It was not hard on Heracles to do
          this, for his thoughts were ever upon Deianira.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Telamon
          rejoiced, for he loved Hesione greatly. On the day they married
          Heracles showed the two an eagle in the sky. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span> He said it was sent as an
          omen to them—an omen for their marriage. And in memory of that omen
          Telamon named his son <span class="tei tei-q">“Aias”</span>; that
          is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Eagle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the walls
          of Troy were repaired and Heracles turned toward Lydia, Omphale’s
          home. Not long would he have to serve Omphale now, for his three
          years’ slavery was nearly over. Soon he would go back to Calydon
          and wed Deianira.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As he went
          along the road to Lydia he thought of all the pleasantries that had
          been made in Omphale’s house and he laughed at the memory of them.
          Lydia was a friendly country, and even though he had been in
          slavery Heracles had had his good times there.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He was tired
          with the journey and made sleepy with the heat of the sun, and when
          he came within sight of Omphale’s house he lay down by the side of
          the road, first taking off his armor, and laying aside his bow, his
          quiver, and his shield. He wakened up to see two men looking down
          upon him; he knew that these were the Cercopes, robbers who waylaid
          travelers upon this road. They were laughing as they looked down on
          him, and Heracles saw that they held his arms and his armor in
          their hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They thought
          that this man, for all his tallness, would yield to them when he
          saw that they had his arms and his armor. But Heracles sprang up,
          and he caught one by the waist and the other by the neck, and he
          turned them upside down and tied them together by the heels. Now he
          held them securely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span> and he would take them to the town and give them over
          to those whom they had waylaid and robbed. He hung them by their
          heels across his shoulders and marched on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the
          robbers, as they were being bumped along, began to relate
          pleasantries and mirthful tales to each other, and Heracles,
          listening, had to laugh. And one said to the other, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my brother, we are in the position of the frogs when
          the mice fell upon them with such fury.”</span> And the other said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed nothing can save us if Zeus does
          not send an ally to us as he sent an ally to the frogs.”</span> And
          the first robber said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who began that
          conflict, the frogs or the mice?”</span> And thereupon the second
          robber, his head reaching down to Heracles’s waist, began:</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">The Battle of the Frogs and
            Mice</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A warlike
            mouse came down to the brink of a pond for no other reason than
            to take a drink of water. Up to him hopped a frog. Speaking in
            the voice of one who had rule and authority, the frog said:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Stranger to our shore, you may not know it, but I am
            Puff Jaw, king of the frogs. I do not speak to common mice, but
            you, as I judge, belong to the noble and kingly sort. Tell me
            your race. If I know it to be a noble one I shall show you my
            kingly friendship.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The mouse,
            speaking haughtily, said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Crumb
            Snatcher, and my race is a famous one. My father is the heroic
            Bread <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span>
            Nibbler, and he married Quern Licker, the lovely daughter of a
            king. Like all my race I am a warrior who has never been wont to
            flinch in battle. Moreover, I have been brought up as a mouse of
            high degree, and figs and nuts, cheese and honey-cakes is the
            provender that I have been fed on.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now this
            reply of Crumb Snatcher pleased the kingly frog greatly.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Come with me to my abode, illustrious
            Crumb Snatcher,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I
            shall show you such entertainment as may be found in the house of
            a king.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the mouse
            looked sharply at him. <span class="tei tei-q">“How may I get to
            your house?”</span> he asked. <span class="tei tei-q">“We live in
            different elements, you and I. We mice want to be in the driest
            of dry places, while you frogs have your abodes in the
            water.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ah,”</span> answered Puff Jaw, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“you do not know how favored the frogs are above all
            other creatures. To us alone the gods have given the power to
            live both in the water and on the land. I shall take you to my
            land palace that is the other side of the pond.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“How may I go there with you?”</span> asked Crumb
            Snatcher the mouse, doubtfully.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Upon my back,”</span> said the frog. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Up now, noble Crumb Snatcher. And as we go I will
            show you the wonders of the deep.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He offered
            his back and Crumb Snatcher bravely mounted. The mouse put his
            forepaws around the frog’s neck. Then Puff Jaw swam out. Crumb
            Snatcher at first was pleased to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page249">[pg 249]</span> feel himself moving through the water.
            But as the dark waves began to rise his mighty heart began to
            quail. He longed to be back upon the land. He groaned aloud.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“How quickly we get on,”</span> cried Puff Jaw;
            <span class="tei tei-q">“soon we shall be at my land
            palace.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heartened by
            this speech, Crumb Snatcher put his tail into the water and
            worked it as a steering oar. On and on they went, and Crumb
            Snatcher gained heart for the adventure. What a wonderful tale he
            would have to tell to the clans of the mice!</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But suddenly,
            out of the depths of the pond, a water snake raised his horrid
            head. Fearsome did that head seem to both mouse and frog. And
            forgetful of the guest that he carried upon his back, Puff Jaw
            dived down into the water. He reached the bottom of the pond and
            lay on the mud in safety.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But far from
            safety was Crumb Snatcher the mouse. He sank and rose, and sank
            again. His wet fur weighed him down. But before he sank for the
            last time he lifted up his voice and cried out and his cry was
            heard at the brink of the pond:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ah, Puff Jaw, treacherous frog! An evil thing you
            have done, leaving me to drown in the middle of the pond. Had you
            faced me on the land I should have shown you which of us two was
            the better warrior. Now I must lose my life in the water. But I
            tell you my death shall not go unavenged—the cowardly frogs will
            be punished for the ill they have done to me who am the son of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Crumb
            Snatcher sank for the last time. But Lick Platter, who was at the
            brink of the pond, had heard his words. Straightway this mouse
            rushed to the hole of Bread Nibbler and told him of the death of
            his princely son.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Bread Nibbler
            called out the clans of the mice. The warrior mice armed
            themselves, and this was the grand way of their arming:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> First, the
            mice put on greaves that covered their forelegs. These they made
            out of bean shells broken in two. For shield, each had a lamp’s
            centerpiece. For spears they had the long bronze needles that
            they had carried out of the houses of men. So armed and so
            accoutered they were ready to war upon the frogs. And Bread
            Nibbler, their king, shouted to them: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Fall upon the cowardly frogs, and leave not one
            alive upon the bank of the pond. Henceforth that bank is ours,
            and ours only. Forward!”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And, on the
            other side, Puff Jaw was urging the frogs to battle. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Let us take our places on the edge of the
            pond,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and when the mice
            come amongst us, let each catch hold of one and throw him into
            the pond. Thus we will get rid of these dry bobs, the
            mice.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The frogs
            applauded the speech of their king, and straightway they went to
            their armor and their weapons. Their legs they covered with the
            leaves of mallow. For breastplates they had the leaves of beets.
            Cabbage leaves, well cut, made their strong shields. They took
            their spears from the pond side—deadly <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page251">[pg 251]</span> pointed rushes they were, and they
            placed upon their heads helmets that were empty snail shells. So
            armed and so accoutered they were ready to meet the grand attack
            of the mice.</p>

            <div class="tei tei-tb">

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the
            robber came to this part of the story Heracles halted his march,
            for he was shaking with laughter. The robber stopped in his
            story. Heracles slapped him on the leg and said: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“What more of the heroic exploits of the
            mice?”</span> The second robber said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
            know no more, but perhaps my brother at the other side of you can
            tell you of the mighty combat between them and the frogs.”</span>
            Then Heracles shifted the first robber from his back to his
            front, and the first robber said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
            tell you what I know about the heroical combat between the frogs
            and the mice.”</span> And thereupon he began:</p>

            <div class="tei tei-tb">
              &nbsp;
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The gnats
            blew their trumpets. This was the dread signal for war.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Bread Nibbler
            struck the first blow. He fell upon Loud Crier the frog, and
            overthrew him. At this Loud Crier’s friend, Reedy, threw down
            spear and shield and dived into the water. This seemed to presage
            victory for the mice. But then Water Larker, the most warlike of
            the frogs, took up a great pebble and flung it at Ham Nibbler who
            was then pursuing Reedy. Down fell Ham Nibbler, and there was
            dismay in the ranks of the mice.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Cabbage
            Climber, a great-hearted frog, took up a clod <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span> of mud and flung it
            full at a mouse that was coming furiously upon him. That mouse’s
            helmet was knocked off and his forehead was plastered with the
            clod of mud, so that he was well-nigh blinded.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It was then
            that victory inclined to the frogs. Bread Nibbler again came into
            the fray. He rushed furiously upon Puff Jaw the king.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Leeky, the
            trusted friend of Puff Jaw, opposed Bread Nibbler’s onslaught.
            Mightily he drove his spear at the king of the mice. But the
            point of the spear broke upon Bread Nibbler’s shield, and then
            Leeky was overthrown.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Bread Nibbler
            came upon Puff Jaw, and the two great kings faced each other. The
            frogs and the mice drew aside, and there was a pause in the
            combat. Bread Nibbler the mouse struck Puff Jaw the frog terribly
            upon the toes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Puff Jaw drew
            out of the battle. Now all would have been lost for the frogs had
            not Zeus, the father of the gods, looked down upon the
            battle.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Dear, dear,”</span> said Zeus, <span class=

            be annihilated if the charge of yonder mouse is not
            halted.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> For the
            father of the gods, looking down, saw a warrior mouse coming on
            in the most dreadful onslaught of the whole battle. Slice
            Snatcher was the name of this warrior. He had come late into the
            field. He waited to split a chestnut in two and to put the halves
            upon his paws. Then, furiously dashing amongst <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span> the frogs, he cried out
            that he would not leave the ground until he had destroyed the
            race, leaving the bank of the pond a playground for the mice and
            for the mice alone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> To stop the
            charge of Slice Snatcher there was nothing for Zeus to do but to
            hurl the thunderbolt that is the terror of gods and men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Frogs and
            mice were awed by the thunder and the flame. But still the mice,
            urged on by Slice Snatcher, did not hold back from their
            onslaught upon the frogs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Now would the
            frogs have been utterly destroyed; but, as they dashed on, the
            mice encountered a new and a dreadful army. The warriors in these
            ranks had mailed backs and curving claws. They had bandy legs and
            long-stretching arms. They had eyes that looked behind them. They
            came on sideways. These were the crabs, creatures until now
            unknown to the mice. And the crabs had been sent by Zeus to save
            the race of the frogs from utter destruction.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Coming upon
            the mice they nipped their paws. The mice turned around and they
            nipped their tails. In vain the boldest of the mice struck at the
            crabs with their sharpened spears. Not upon the hard shells on
            the backs of the crabs did the spears of the mice make any dint.
            On and on, on their queer feet and with their terrible nippers,
            the crabs went. Bread Nibbler could not rally them any more, and
            Slice Snatcher ceased to speak of the monument of victory that
            the mice would erect upon the bank of the pond. <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> With their
            heads out of the water they had retreated to, the frogs watched
            the finish of the battle. The mice threw down their spears and
            shields and fled from the battleground. On went the crabs as if
            they cared nothing for their victory, and the frogs came out of
            the water and sat upon the bank and watched them in awe.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles had
            laughed at the diverting tale that the robbers had told him; he
            could not bring them then to a place where they would meet with
            captivity or death. He let them loose upon the highway, and the
            robbers thanked him with high-flowing speeches, and they declared
            that if they should ever find him sleeping by the roadway again
            they would let him lie. Saying this they went away, and Heracles,
            laughing as he thought upon the great exploits of the frogs and
            mice, went on to Omphale’s house.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Omphale, the
            widow, received him mirthfully, and then set him to do tasks in
            the kitchen while she sat and talked to him about Troy and the
            affairs of King Laomedon. And afterward she put on his lion’s
            skin, and went about in the courtyard dragging the heavy club
            after her. Mirthfully and pleasantly she made the rest of his
            time in Lydia pass for Heracles, and the last day of his slavery
            soon came, and he bade good-by to Omphale, that pleasant widow,
            and to Lydia, and he started off for Calydon to claim his bride
            Deianira.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Beautiful
            indeed Deianira looked now that she had ceased to <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span> mourn for her brother,
            for the laughter that had been under her grief always now flashed
            out even while she looked priestesslike and of good counsel; her
            dark eyes shone like stars, and her being had the spirit of one
            who wanders from camp to camp, always greeting friends and
            leaving friends behind her. Heracles and Deianira wed, and they
            set out for Tiryns, where a king had left a kingdom to
            Heracles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They came to
            the River Evenus. Heracles could have crossed the river by
            himself, but he could not cross it at the part he came to,
            carrying Deianira. He and she went along the river, seeking a
            ferry that might take them across. They wandered along the side
            of the river, happy with each other, and they came to a place
            where they had sight of a centaur.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles knew
            this centaur. He was Nessus, one of the centaurs whom he had
            chased up the mountain the time when he went to hunt the
            Erymanthean boar. The centaurs knew him, and Nessus spoke to
            Heracles as if he had friendship for him. He would, he said,
            carry Heracles’s bride across the river.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
            crossed the river, and he waited on the other side for Nessus and
            Deianira. Nessus went to another part of the river to make his
            crossing. Then Heracles, upon the other bank, heard screams—the
            screams of his wife, Deianira. He saw that the centaur was
            savagely attacking her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
            leveled his bow and he shot at Nessus. Arrow after arrow he shot
            into the centaur’s body. Nessus loosed his <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span> hold on Deianira, and
            he lay down on the bank of the river, his lifeblood streaming
            from him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Nessus,
            dying, but with his rage against Heracles unabated, thought of a
            way by which the hero might be made to suffer for the death he
            had brought upon him. He called to Deianira, and she, seeing he
            could do her no more hurt, came close to him. He told her that in
            repentance for his attack upon her he would bestow a great gift
            upon her. She was to gather up some of the blood that flowed from
            him; his blood, the centaur said, would be a love philter, and if
            ever her husband’s love for her waned it would grow fresh again
            if she gave to him something from her hands that would have this
            blood upon it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Deianira, who
            had heard from Heracles of the wisdom of the centaurs, believed
            what Nessus told her. She took a phial and let the blood pour
            into it. Then Nessus plunged into the river and died there as
            Heracles came up to where Deianira stood.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She did not
            speak to him about the centaur’s words to her, nor did she tell
            him that she had hidden away the phial that had Nessus’s blood in
            it. They crossed the river at another point and they came after a
            time to Tiryns and to the kingdom that had been left to
            Heracles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> There
            Heracles and Deianira lived, and a son who was named Hyllos was
            born to them. And after a time Heracles was led into a war with
            Eurytus—Eurytus who was king of Oichalia.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Word came to
            Deianira that Oichalia was taken by Heracles, and that the king
            and his daughter Iole were held captive. <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page257">[pg 257]</span> Deianira knew that Heracles had once
            tried to win this maiden for his wife, and she feared that the
            sight of Iole would bring his old longing back to him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She thought
            upon the words that Nessus had said to her, and even as she
            thought upon them messengers came from Heracles to ask her to
            send him a robe—a beautifully woven robe that she had—that he
            might wear it while making a sacrifice. Deianira took down the
            robe; through this robe, she thought, the blood of the centaur
            could touch Heracles and his love for her would revive. Thinking
            this she poured Nessus’s blood over the robe.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles was
            in Oichalia when the messengers returned to him. He took the robe
            that Deianira sent, and he went to a mountain that overlooked the
            sea that he might make the sacrifice there. Iole went with him.
            Then he put on the robe that Deianira had sent. When it touched
            his flesh the robe burst into flame. Heracles tried to tear it
            off, but deeper and deeper into his flesh the flames went. They
            burned and burned and none could quench them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Heracles
            knew that his end was near. He would die by fire, and knowing
            that he piled up a great heap of wood and he climbed upon it.
            There he stayed with the flaming robe burning into him, and he
            begged of those who passed to fire the pile that his end might
            come more quickly.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> None would
            fire the pile. But at last there came that way a young warrior
            named Philoctetes, and Heracles begged of him to fire the pile.
            Philoctetes, knowing that it was the will of <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span> the gods that Heracles
            should die that way, lighted the pile. For that Heracles bestowed
            upon him his great bow and his unerring arrows. And it was this
            bow and these arrows, brought from Philoctetes, that afterward
            helped to take Priam’s city.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The pile that
            Heracles stood upon was fired. High up, above the sea, the pile
            burned. All who were near that burning fled—all except Iole, that
            childlike maiden. She stayed and watched the flames mount up and
            up. They wrapped the sky, and the voice of Heracles was heard
            calling upon Zeus. Then a great chariot came and Heracles was
            borne away to Olympus. Thus, after many labors, Heracles passed
            away, a mortal passing into an immortal being in a great burning
            high above the sea.</p>

          Apollo was happy whilst serving Admetus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Afterward
          people wondered at Admetus’s ever-smiling face and ever-radiant
          being. It was the god’s kindly thought of him that gave him such
          happiness. And when Apollo was leaving his house and his fields he
          revealed himself to Admetus, and he made a promise to him that when
          the god of the Underworld sent Death for him he would have one more
          chance of baffling Death than any mortal man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> That was before
          Admetus sailed on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> with Jason and the companions
          of the quest. The companionship of Admetus brought happiness to
          many on the voyage, but the hero to whom it gave the most happiness
          was Heracles. And often Heracles would have Admetus beside him to
          tell him about the radiant god Apollo, whose bow and arrows
          Heracles had been given.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> After that
          voyage and after the hunt in Calydon Admetus went back to his own
          land. There he wed that fair and loving woman, Alcestis. He might
          not wed her until he had yoked lions and leopards to the chariot
          that drew her. This was a feat that no hero had been able to
          accomplish. With Apollo’s aid he accomplished it. Thereafter
          Admetus, having the love of Alcestis, was even more happy than he
          had been before. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
          260]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> One day as he
          walked by fold and through pasture field he saw a figure standing
          beside his herd of black cattle. A radiant figure it was, and
          Admetus knew that this was Apollo come to him again. He went toward
          the god and he made reverence and began to speak to him. But Apollo
          turned to Admetus a face that was without joy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What years of happiness have been mine, O Apollo,
          through your friendship for me,”</span> said Admetus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, as I walked my pasture land to-day it came into my
          mind how much I loved this green earth and the blue sky! And all
          that I know of love and happiness has come to me through
          you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But still
          Apollo stood before him with a face that was without joy. He spoke
          and his voice was not that clear and vibrant voice that he had once
          in speaking to Admetus. <span class="tei tei-q">“Admetus,
          Admetus,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is for me to
          tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon
          the green earth. It is for me to tell you that the god of the
          Underworld will have you come to him. Admetus, Admetus, know that
          even now the god of the Underworld is sending Death for
          you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the light
          of the world went out for Admetus, and he heard himself speaking to
          Apollo in a shaking voice: <span class="tei tei-q">“O Apollo,
          Apollo, thou art a god, and surely thou canst save me! Save me now
          from this Death that the god of the Underworld is sending for
          me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But Apollo
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Long ago, Admetus, I made a bargain
          with the god of the Underworld on thy behalf. Thou hast been
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span> given a
          chance more than any mortal man. If one will go willingly in thy
          place with Death, thou canst still live on. Go, Admetus. Thou art
          well loved, and it may be that thou wilt find one to take thy
          place.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Apollo
          went up unto the mountaintop and Admetus stayed for a while beside
          the cattle. It seemed to him that a little of the darkness had
          lifted from the world. He would go to his palace. There were aged
          men and women there, servants and slaves, and one of them would
          surely be willing to take the king’s place and go with Death down
          to the Underworld.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Admetus
          thought as he went toward the palace. And then he came upon an
          ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard, grinding corn
          between two stones. Long had she been doing that wearisome labor.
          Admetus had known her from the first time he had come into that
          courtyard as a little child, and he had never seen aught in her
          face but a heavy misery. There she was sitting as he had first
          known her, with her eyes bleared and her knees shaking, and with
          the dust of the courtyard and the husks of the corn in her matted
          hair. He went to her and spoke to her, and he asked her to take the
          place of the king and go with Death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But when she
          heard the name of Death horror came into the face of the ancient
          woman, and she cried out that she would not let Death come near
          her. Then Admetus left her, and he came upon another, upon a
          sightless man who held out a shriveled hand for the food that the
          servants of the palace might <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page262">[pg 262]</span> bestow upon him. Admetus took the man’s
          shriveled hand, and he asked him if he would not take the king’s
          place and go with Death that was coming for him. The sightless man,
          with howls and shrieks, said he would not go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Admetus
          went into the palace and into the chamber where his bed was, and he
          lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with
          Death that was coming for him from the god of the Underworld, and
          he lamented that none of the wretched ones around the palace would
          take his place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> A hand was laid
          upon him. He looked up and he saw his tall and grave-eyed wife,
          Alcestis, beside him. Alcestis spoke to him slowly and gravely.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have heard what you have said, O my
          husband,”</span> said she. <span class="tei tei-q">“One should go
          in your place, for you are the king and have many great affairs to
          attend to. And if none other will go, I, Alcestis, will go in your
          place, Admetus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It had seemed
          to Admetus that ever since he had heard the words of Apollo that
          heavy footsteps were coming toward him. Now the footsteps seemed to
          stop. It was not so terrible for him as before. He sprang up, and
          he took the hands of Alcestis and he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You, then, will take my place?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will go with Death in your place, Admetus,”</span>
          Alcestis said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, even as
          Admetus looked into her face, he saw a pallor come upon her; her
          body weakened and she sank down upon the bed. Then, watching over
          her, he knew that not he but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page263">[pg 263]</span> Alcestis would go with Death. And the
          words he had spoken he would have taken back—the words that had
          brought her consent to go with Death in his place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Paler and
          weaker Alcestis grew. Death would soon be here for her. No, not
          here, for he would not have Death come into the palace. He lifted
          Alcestis from the bed and he carried her from the palace. He
          carried her to the temple of the gods. He laid her there upon the
          bier and waited there beside her. No more speech came from her. He
          went back to the palace where all was silent—the servants moved
          about with heads bowed, lamenting silently for their mistress.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.20em"><span style=
          "font-size: 120%">II</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As Admetus was
          coming back from the temple he heard a great shout; he looked up
          and saw one standing at the palace doorway. He knew him by his
          lion’s skin and his great height. This was Heracles—Heracles come
          to visit him, but come at a sad hour. He could not now rejoice in
          the company of Heracles. And yet Heracles might be on his way from
          the accomplishment of some great labor, and it would not be right
          to say a word that might turn him away from his doorway; he might
          have much need of rest and refreshment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Thinking this
          Admetus went up to Heracles and took his hand and welcomed him into
          his house. <span class="tei tei-q">“How is it with you, friend
          Admetus?”</span> Heracles asked. Admetus would only say
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span> that nothing
          was happening in his house and that Heracles, his hero-companion,
          was welcome there. His mind was upon a great sacrifice, he said,
          and so he would not be able to feast with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The servants
          brought Heracles to the bath, and then showed him where a feast was
          laid for him. And as for Admetus, he went within the chamber, and
          knelt beside the bed on which Alcestis had lain, and thought of his
          terrible loss.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles, after
          the bath, put on the brightly colored tunic that the servants of
          Admetus brought him. He put a wreath upon his head and sat down to
          the feast. It was a pity, he thought, that Admetus was not feasting
          with him. But this was only the first of many feasts. And thinking
          of what companionship he would have with Admetus, Heracles left the
          feasting hall and came to where the servants were standing about in
          silence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why is the house of Admetus so hushed to-day?”</span>
          Heracles asked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is because of what is befalling,”</span> said one
          of the servants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, the sacrifice that the king is making,”</span>
          said Heracles. <span class="tei tei-q">“To what god is that
          sacrifice due?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To the god of the Underworld,”</span> said the
          servant. <span class="tei tei-q">“Death is coming to Alcestis the
          queen where she lies on a bier in the temple of the
          gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the
          servant told Heracles the story of how Alcestis had taken her
          husband’s place, going in his stead with Death. Heracles thought
          upon the sorrow of his friend, and of the great <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span> sacrifice that his wife
          was making for him. How noble it was of Admetus to bring him into
          his house and give entertainment to him while such sorrow was upon
          him. And then Heracles felt that another labor was before him.</p>

          thought, <span class="tei tei-q">“the hound that guards those whom
          Death brings down into the realm of the god of the Underworld. Why
          should I not strive with Death? And what a noble thing it would be
          to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband!
          This is a labor that has not been laid upon me, and it is a labor I
          will undertake.”</span> So Heracles said to himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He left the
          palace of Admetus and he went to the temple of the gods. He stood
          inside the temple and he saw the bier on which Alcestis was laid.
          He looked upon the queen. Death had not touched her yet, although
          she lay so still and so silent. Heracles would watch beside her and
          strive with Death for her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Heracles
          watched and Death came. When Death entered the temple Heracles laid
          hands upon him. Death had never been gripped by mortal hands and he
          strode on as if that grip meant nothing to him. But then he had to
          grip Heracles. In Death’s grip there was a strength beyond
          strength. And upon Heracles a dreadful sense of loss came as Death
          laid hands upon him—a sense of the loss of light and the loss of
          breath and the loss of movement. But Heracles struggled with Death
          although his breath went and his strength seemed to go from him. He
          held that stony body to him, and the cold of that body went through
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span> him, and its
          stoniness seemed to turn his bones to stone, but still Heracles
          strove with him, and at last he overthrew him and he held Death
          down upon the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now you are held by me, Death,”</span> cried Heracles.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You are held by me, and the god of the
          Underworld will be made angry because you cannot go about his
          business—either this business or any other business. You are held
          by me, Death, and you will not be let go unless you promise to go
          forth from this temple without bringing one with you.”</span> And
          Death, knowing that Heracles could hold him there, and that the
          business of the god of the Underworld would be left undone if he
          were held, promised that he would leave the temple without bringing
          one with him. Then Heracles took his grip off Death, and that stony
          shape went from the temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Soon a flush
          came into the face of Alcestis as Heracles watched over her. Soon
          she arose from the bier on which she had been laid. She called out
          to Admetus, and Heracles went to her and spoke to her, telling her
          that he would bring her back to her husband’s house.</p>

          his palace. Dawn was coming, and as he looked toward the temple he
          saw Heracles coming to the palace. A woman came with him. She was
          veiled, and Admetus could not see her features. <span class=

          the minstrels who, in the early days, went through the world,
          telling to men the stories of the gods, telling of their wars and
          their births. Of all these minstrels none was so famous as Orpheus
          who had gone with the Argonauts; none could tell truer things about
          the gods, for he himself was half divine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But a great
          grief came to Orpheus, a grief that stopped his singing and his
          playing upon the lyre. His young wife Eurydice was taken from him.
          One day, walking in the garden, she was bitten on the heel by a
          serpent, and straightway she went down to the world of the
          dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then everything
          in this world was dark and bitter for the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page269">[pg 269]</span> minstrel Orpheus; sleep would not come
          to him, and for him food had no taste. Then Orpheus said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will do that which no mortal has ever
          done before; I will do that which even the immortals might shrink
          from doing: I will go down into the world of the dead, and I will
          bring back to the living and to the light my bride
          Eurydice.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Orpheus
          went on his way to the valley of Acherusia which goes down, down
          into the world of the dead. He would never have found his way to
          that valley if the trees had not shown him the way. For as he went
          along Orpheus played upon his lyre and sang, and the trees heard
          his song and they were moved by his grief, and with their arms and
          their heads they showed him the way to the deep, deep valley of
          Acherusia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Down, down by
          winding paths through that deepest and most shadowy of all valleys
          Orpheus went. He came at last to the great gate that opens upon the
          world of the dead. And the silent guards who keep watch there for
          the rulers of the dead were affrighted when they saw a living
          being, and they would not let Orpheus approach the gate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But the
          minstrel, knowing the reason for their fear, said: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am not Heracles come again to drag up from the world
          of the dead your three-headed dog Cerberus. I am Orpheus, and all
          that my hands can do is to make music upon my lyre.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then he
          took the lyre in his hands and played upon it. As he played, the
          silent watchers gathered around him, leaving the gate unguarded.
          And as he played the rulers of the dead <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page270">[pg 270]</span> came forth, Aidoneus and Persephone,
          and listened to the words of the living man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The cause of my coming through the dark and fearful
          ways,”</span> sang Orpheus, <span class="tei tei-q">“is to strive
          to gain a fairer fate for Eurydice, my bride. All that is above
          must come down to you at last, O rulers of the most lasting world.
          But before her time has Eurydice been brought here. I have desired
          strength to endure her loss, but I cannot endure it. And I come
          before you, Aidoneus and Persephone, brought here by
          Love.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When Orpheus
          said the name of Love, Persephone, the queen of the dead, bowed her
          young head, and bearded Aidoneus, the king, bowed his head also.
          Persephone remembered how Demeter, her mother, had sought her all
          through the world, and she remembered the touch of her mother’s
          tears upon her face. And Aidoneus remembered how his love for
          Persephone had led him to carry her away from the valley in the
          upper world where she had been gathering flowers. He and Persephone
          bowed their heads and stood aside, and Orpheus went through the
          gate and came amongst the dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Still upon his
          lyre he played. Tantalus—who, for his crimes, had been condemned to
          stand up to his neck in water and yet never be able to assuage his
          thirst—Tantalus heard, and for a while did not strive to put his
          lips toward the water that ever flowed away from him; Sisyphus—who
          had been condemned to roll up a hill a stone that ever rolled
          back—Sisyphus heard the music that Orpheus played, and for a while
          he sat still <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span>
          upon his stone. And even those dread ones who bring to the dead the
          memories of all their crimes and all their faults, even the
          Eumenides had their cheeks wet with tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In the throng
          of the newly come dead Orpheus saw Eurydice. She looked upon her
          husband, but she had not the power to come near him. But slowly she
          came when Aidoneus called her. Then with joy Orpheus took her
          hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> It would be
          granted them—no mortal ever gained such privilege before—to leave,
          both together, the world of the dead, and to abide for another
          space in the world of the living. One condition there would be—that
          on their way up through the valley of Acherusia neither Orpheus nor
          Eurydice should look back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They went
          through the gate and came amongst the watchers that are around the
          portals. These showed them the path that went up through the valley
          of Acherusia. That way they went, Orpheus and Eurydice, he going
          before her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Up and up
          through the darkened ways they went, Orpheus knowing that Eurydice
          was behind him, but never looking back upon her. But as he went,
          his heart was filled with things to tell—how the trees were
          blossoming in the garden she had left; how the water was sparkling
          in the fountain; how the doors of the house stood open, and how
          they, sitting together, would watch the sunlight on the laurel
          bushes. All these things were in his heart to tell her, to tell her
          who came behind him, silent and unseen. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page272">[pg 272]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now they
          were nearing the place where the valley of Acherusia opened on the
          world of the living. Orpheus looked on the blue of the sky. A
          white-winged bird flew by. Orpheus turned around and cried,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O Eurydice, look upon the world that I
          have won you back to!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He turned to
          say this to her. He saw her with her long dark hair and pale face.
          He held out his arms to clasp her. But in that instant she slipped
          back into the depths of the valley. And all he heard spoken was a
          single word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell!”</span> Long, long
          had it taken Eurydice to climb so far, but in the moment of his
          turning around she had fallen back to her place amongst the
          dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Down through
          the valley of Acherusia Orpheus went again. Again he came before
          the watchers of the gate. But now he was not looked at nor listened
          to, and, hopeless, he had to return to the world of the living.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The birds were
          his friends now, and the trees and the stones. The birds flew
          around him and mourned with him; the trees and stones often
          followed him, moved by the music of his lyre. But a savage band
          slew Orpheus and threw his severed head and his lyre into the River
          Hebrus. It is said by the poets that while they floated in
          midstream the lyre gave out some mournful notes and the head of
          Orpheus answered the notes with song.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now that he
          was no longer to be counted with the living, Orpheus went down to
          the world of the dead, not going now by that steep descent through
          the valley of Acherusia, but going <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page273">[pg 273]</span> down straightway. The silent watchers let
          him pass, and he went amongst the dead and saw his Eurydice in the
          throng. Again they were together, Orpheus and Eurydice, and as they
          went through the place that King Aidoneus ruled over, they had no
          fear of looking back, one upon the other.</p>

          Medea, unable to win to Iolcus, stayed at Corinth, at the court of
          King Creon. Creon was proud to have Jason in his city, but of Medea
          the king was fearful, for he had heard how she had brought about
          the death of Apsyrtus, her brother.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea wearied
          of this long waiting in the palace of King Creon. A longing came
          upon her to exercise her powers of enchantment. She did not forget
          what Queen Arete had said to her—that if she wished to appease the
          wrath of the gods she should have no more to do with enchantments.
          She did not forget this, but still there grew in her a longing to
          use all her powers of enchantment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Jason, at
          the court of King Creon, had his longings, too. He longed to enter

          longed to destroy Pelias, the murderer <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          longed to be a king, and to rule in the kingdom that Cretheus had
          founded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Once Jason
          spoke to Medea of his longing. <span class="tei tei-q">“O

          many things for thee and this thing also I will do. I will go into
          Iolcus, and by my enchantments I will make clear the way for the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He should have
          remembered then the words of Queen Arete to Medea, but the longing
          that he had for his triumph and his revenge was in the way of his
          remembering. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Medea, help me in
          this with all thine enchantments and thou wilt be more dear to me
          than ever before thou wert.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea then went
          forth from the palace of King Creon and she made more terrible
          spells than ever she had made in Colchis. All night she stayed in a
          tangled place weaving her spells. Dawn came, and she knew that the
          spells she had woven had not been in vain, for beside her there
          stood a car that was drawn by dragons.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea the
          Enchantress had never looked on these dragon shapes before. When
          she looked upon them now she was fearful of them. But then she said
          to herself, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Medea, and I would be a
          greater enchantress and a more cunning woman than I have been, and
          what I have thought of, that will I carry out.”</span> She mounted

          where grew the herbs of magic Medea journeyed in her dragon-drawn
          car—to the Mountains Ossa, Pelion, Œthrys, Pindus, and Olympus;
          then to the rivers Apidanus, Enipeus, and Peneus. She gathered
          herbs on the mountains and grasses on the rivers’ banks; some she
          plucked up by the roots and some she cut with the curved blade of a
          knife. When she had gathered these herbs and grasses she went back
          to Corinth on her dragon-drawn car.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Jason saw
          her; pale and drawn was her face, and her eyes were strange and
          gleaming. He saw her standing by the car drawn by the dragons, and
          a terror of Medea came into his mind. He went toward her, but in a
          harsh voice she bade him not come near to disturb the brewing that
          she was going to begin. Jason turned away. As he went toward the
          palace he saw Glauce, King Creon’s daughter; the maiden was coming
          from the well and she carried a pitcher of water. He thought how
          fair Glauce looked in the light of the morning, how the wind played
          with her hair and her garments, and how far away she was from
          witcheries and enchantments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> As for Medea,
          she placed in a heap beside her the magic herbs and grasses she had
          gathered. Then she put them in a bronze pot and boiled them in
          water from the stream. Soon froth came on the boiling, and Medea
          stirred the pot with a withered branch of an apple tree. The branch
          was withered—it was indeed no more than a dry stick, but as she
          stirred the herbs and grasses with it, first leaves, then flowers,
          and lastly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span>
          bright gleaming apples came on it. And when the pot boiled over and
          drops from it fell upon the ground, there grew up out of the dry
          earth soft grasses and flowers. Such was the power of renewal that
          was in the magical brew that Medea had made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She filled a
          phial with the liquid she had brewed, and she scattered the rest in
          the wild places of the garden. Then, taking the phial and the
          apples that had grown on the withered branch, she mounted the car
          drawn by the dragons, and she went once more from Corinth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On she
          journeyed in her dragon-drawn car until she came to a place that
          was near to Iolcus. There the dragons descended. They had come to a
          dark pool. Medea, making herself naked, stood in that dark pool.
          For a while she looked down upon herself, seeing in the dark water
          her white body and her lovely hair. Then she bathed herself in the
          water. Soon a dread change came over her: she saw her hair become
          scant and gray, and she saw her body become bent and withered. She
          stepped out of the pool a withered and witchlike woman; when she
          dressed herself the rich clothes that she had worn before hung
          loosely upon her, and she looked the more forbidding because of
          them. She bade the dragons go, and they flew through the air with
          the empty car. Then she hid in her dress the phial with the liquid
          she had brewed and the apples that had grown upon the withered
          branch. She picked up a stick to lean upon, and with the gait of an
          ancient woman she went hobbling upon the road to Iolcus.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> On the streets
          of the city the fierce fighting men that Pelias had brought down
          from the mountains showed themselves; few of the men or women of
          the city showed themselves even in the daytime. Medea went through
          the city and to the palace of King Pelias. But no one might enter
          there, and the guards laid hands upon her and held her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea did not
          struggle with them. She drew from the folds of her dress one of the
          gleaming apples that she carried and she gave it to one of the
          guards. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is for King Pelias,”</span> she
          said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Give the apple to him and then do
          with me as the king would have you do.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The guards
          brought the gleaming apple to the king. When he had taken it into
          his hand and had smelled its fragrance, old trembling Pelias asked
          where the apple had come from. The guards told him it had been
          brought by an ancient woman who was now outside seated on a stone
          in the courtyard.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> He looked on
          the shining apple and he felt its fragrance and he could not help
          thinking, old trembling Pelias, that this apple might be the means
          of bringing him back to the fullness of health and courage that he
          had had before. He sent for the ancient woman who had brought it
          that she might tell him where it had come from and who it was that
          had sent it to him. Then the guards brought Medea before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She saw an old
          man, white-faced and trembling, with shaking hands and eyes that
          looked on her fearfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are
          you,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span>
          he asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“and from whence came the apple
          that you had them bring me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea, standing
          before him, looked a withered and shrunken beldame, a woman bent
          with years, but yet with eyes that were bright and living. She came
          near him and she said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The apple, O King,
          came from the garden that is watched over by the Daughters of the
          Evening Land. He who eats it has a little of the weight of old age
          taken from him. But things more wonderful even than the shining
          apples grow in that far garden. There are plants there the juices
          of which make youthful again all aged and failing things. The apple
          would bring you a little way toward the vigor of your prime. But
          the juices I have can bring you to a time more wonderful—back even
          to the strength and the glory of your youth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> When the king
          heard her say this a light came into his heavy eyes, and his hands
          caught Medea and drew her to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are
          you?”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“who speak of the
          garden watched over by the Daughters of the Evening Land? Who are
          you who speak of juices that can bring back one to the strength and
          glory of his youth?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea answered:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a woman who has known many and great
          griefs, O king. My griefs have brought me through the world. Many
          have searched for the garden watched over by the Daughters of the
          Evening Land, but I came to it unthinkingly, and without wanting
          them I gathered the gleaming apples and took from the plants there
          the juices that can bring youth back.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If you have been able to come by those
          juices, how is it that you remain in woeful age and
          decrepitude?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Because of my many griefs, king, I would
          not renew my life. I would be ever nearer death and the end of all
          things. But you are a king and have all things you desire at your
          hand—beauty and state and power. Surely if any one would desire it,
          you would desire to have youth back to you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias, when he
          heard her say this, knew that besides youth there was nothing that
          he desired. After crimes that had gone through the whole of his
          manhood he had secured for himself the kingdom that Cretheus had
          founded. But old age had come on him, and the weakness of old age,
          and the power he had won was falling from his hands. He would be
          overthrown in his weakness, or else he would soon come to die, and
          there would be an end then to his name and to his kingship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> How fortunate
          above all kings he would be, he thought, if it could be that some
          one should come to him with juices that would renew his youth! He
          looked longingly into the eyes of the ancient-seeming woman before
          him, and he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“How is it that you show
          no gains from the juices that you speak of? You are old and in
          woeful decrepitude. Even if you would not win back to youth you
          could have got riches and state for that which you say you
          possess.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Medea
          said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have lost so much and have
          suffered so much that I would not have youth back at the price of
          facing the years. I would sink down to the quiet of the grave. But
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span> I hope for
          some ease before I die—for the ease that is in king’s houses, with
          good food to eat, and rest, and servants to wait upon one’s aged
          body. These are the things I desire, O Pelias, even as you desire
          youth. You can give me such things, and I have come to you who
          desire youth eagerly rather than to kings who have a less eager
          desire for it. To you I will give the juices that bring one back to
          the strength and the glory of youth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have only your word for it that you
          possess these juices. Many there are who come and say deceiving
          things to a king.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Said Medea:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let there be no more words between us, O
          king. To-morrow I will show you the virtue of the juices I have
          brought with me. Have a great vat prepared—a vat that a man could
          lay himself in with the water covering him. Have this vat filled
          with water, and bring to it the oldest creature you can get—a ram
          or a goat that is the oldest of their flock. Do this, O king, and
          you will be shown a thing to wonder at and to be hopeful
          over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So Medea said,
          and then she turned around and left the king’s presence. Pelias
          called to his guards and he bade them take the woman into their
          charge and treat her considerately. The guards took Medea away.
          Then all day the king mused on what had been told him and a wild
          hope kept beating about his heart. He had the servants prepare a
          great vat in the lower chambers, and he had his shepherd bring him
          a ram that was the oldest in the flock. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page281">[pg 281]</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Only Medea was
          permitted to come into that chamber with the king; the ways to it
          were guarded, and all that took place in it was secret. Medea was
          brought to the closed door by her guard. She opened it and she saw
          the king there and the vat already prepared; she saw a ram tethered
          near the vat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Medea looked
          upon the king. In the light of the torches his face was white and
          fierce and his mouth moved gaspingly. She spoke to him quietly, and
          said: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no need for you to hear me
          speak. You will watch a great miracle, for behold! the ram which is
          the oldest and feeblest in the flock will become young and
          invigorated when it comes forth from this vat.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She untethered
          the ram, and with the help of Pelias drew it to the vat. This was
          not hard to do, for the beast was very feeble; its feet could
          hardly bear it upright, its wool was yellow and stayed only in
          patches on its shrunken body. Easily the beast was forced into the
          vat. Then Medea drew the phial out of her bosom and poured into the
          water some of the brew she had made in Creon’s garden in Corinth.
          The water in the vat took on a strange bubbling, and the ram sank
          down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then Medea,
          standing beside the vat, sang an incantation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Earth,”</span> she sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          Earth who dost provide wise men with potent herbs, O Earth help me
          now. I am she who can drive the clouds; I am she who can dispel the
          winds; I am she who can break the jaws of serpents with my
          incantations; I am she who can uproot living trees and rocks; who
          can make the mountains shake; who can bring the ghosts from their
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span> tombs. O
          Earth, help me now.”</span> At this strange incantation the mixture
          in the vat boiled and bubbled more and more. Then the boiling and
          bubbling ceased. Up to the surface came the ram. Medea helped it to
          struggle out of the vat, and then it turned and smote the vat with
          its head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias took
          down a torch and stood before the beast. Vigorous indeed was the
          ram, and its wool was white and grew evenly upon it. They could not
          tether it again, and when the servants were brought into the
          chamber it took two of them to drag away the ram.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The king was
          most eager to enter the vat and have Medea put in the brew and
          speak the incantation over it. But Medea bade him wait until the
          morrow. All night the king lay awake, thinking of how he might
          regain his youth and his strength and be secure and triumphant
          thereafter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> At the first
          light he sent for Medea and he told her that he would have the vat
          made ready and that he would go into it that night. Medea looked
          upon him, and the helplessness that he showed made her want to work
          a greater evil upon him, or, if not upon him, upon his house. How
          soon it would have reached its end, all her plot for the
          destruction of this king! But she would leave in the king’s house a
          misery that would not have an end so soon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So she said to
          the king: <span class="tei tei-q">“I would say the incantation over
          a beast of the field, but over a king I could not say it. Let those
          of your own blood be with you when you enter the vat that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span> will bring
          such change to you. Have your daughters there. I will give them the
          juice to mix in the vat, and I will teach them the incantation that
          has to be said.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> So she said,
          and she made Pelias consent to having his daughters and not Medea
          in the chamber of the vat. They were sent for and they came before
          Medea, the daughters of King Pelias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> They were women
          who had been borne down by the tyranny of their father; they stood
          before him now, two dim-eyed creatures, very feeble and fearful. To
          them Medea gave the phial that had in it the liquid to mix in the
          vat; also she taught them the words of the incantation, but she
          taught them to use these words wrongly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> The vat was
          prepared in the lower chambers; Pelias and his daughters went
          there, and the chamber was guarded, and what happened there was in
          secret. Pelias went into the vat; the brew was thrown into it, and
          the vat boiled and bubbled as before. Pelias sank down in it. Over
          him then his daughters said the magic words as Medea had taught
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Pelias sank
          down, but he did not rise again. The hours went past and the
          morning came, and the daughters of King Pelias raised frightened
          laments. Over the sides of the vat the mixture boiled and bubbled,
          and Pelias was to be seen at the bottom with his limbs stiffened in
          death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then the guards
          came, and they took King Pelias out of the vat and left him in his
          royal chamber. The word went through the palace that the king was
          dead. There was a hush in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page284">[pg 284]</span> palace then, but not the hush of grief.
          One by one servants and servitors stole away from the palace that
          was hated by all. Then there was clatter in the streets as the
          fierce fighting men from the mountains galloped away with what
          plunder they could seize. And through all this the daughters of
          King Pelias sat crouching in fear above the body of their
          father.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And Medea,
          still an ancient woman seemingly, went through the crowds that now
          came on the streets of the city. She told those she went amongst
          that the son of Æson was alive and would soon be in their midst.
          Hearing this the men of the city formed a council of elders to rule
          the people until Jason’s coming. In such way Medea brought about
          the end of King Pelias’s reign.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> In triumph she
          went through the city. But as she was passing the temple her dress
          was caught and held, and turning around she faced the ancient
          priestess of Artemis, Iphias. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art
          Æetes’s daughter,”</span> Iphias said, <span class="tei tei-q">“who
          in deceit didst come into Iolcus. Woe to thee and woe to Jason for
          what thou hast done this day! Not for the slaying of Pelias art
          thou blameworthy, but for the misery that thou hast brought upon
          his daughters by bringing them into the guilt of the slaying. Go
          from the city, daughter of King Æetes; never, never wilt thou come
          back into it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> But little heed
          did Medea pay to the ancient priestess, Iphias. Still in the guise
          of an old woman she went through the streets of the city, and out
          through the gate and along the highway <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page285">[pg 285]</span> that led from Iolcus. To that dark pool
          she came where she had bathed herself before. But now she did not
          step into the pool nor pour its water over her shrinking flesh;
          instead she built up two altars of green sods—an altar to Youth and
          an altar to Hecate, queen of the witches; she wreathed them with
          green boughs from the forest, and she prayed before each. Then she
          made herself naked, and she anointed herself with the brew she had
          made from the magical herbs and grasses. All marks of age and
          decrepitude left her, and when she stood over the dark pool and
          looked down on herself she saw that her body was white and shapely
          as before, and that her hair was soft and lovely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> She stayed all
          night between the tangled wood and the dark pool, and with the
          first light the car drawn by the scaly dragons came to her. She
          mounted the car, and she journeyed back to Corinth.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Into Jason’s
          mind a fear of Medea had come since the hour when he had seen her
          mount the car drawn by the scaly dragons. He could not think of her
          any more as the one who had been his companion on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          He thought of her as one who could help him and do wonderful things
          for him, but not as one whom he could talk softly and lovingly to.
          Ah, but if Jason had thought less of his kingdom and less of his
          triumphing with the Fleece of Gold, Medea would not have had the
          dragons come to her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And now that
          his love for Medea had altered, Jason noted the loveliness of
          another—of Glauce, the daughter of Creon, the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span> King of Corinth. And
          Glauce, who had red lips and the eyes of a child, saw in Jason who
          had brought the Golden Fleece out of Colchis the image of every
          hero she had heard about in stories. Creon, the king, often brought
          Jason and Glauce together, for his hope was that the hero would wed
          his daughter and stay in Corinth and strengthen his kingdom. He
          thought that Medea, that strange woman, could not keep a
          companionship with Jason.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Two were
          walking in the king’s garden, and they were Jason and Glauce. A
          shadow fell between them, and when Jason looked up he saw Medea’s
          dragon car. Down flew the dragons, and Medea came from the car and
          stood between Jason and the princess. Angrily she spoke to him.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have made the kingdom ready for your
          return,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“but if you would
          go there you must first let me deal in my own way with this pretty
          maiden.”</span> And so fiercely did Medea look upon her that Glauce
          shrank back and clung to Jason for protection. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O, Jason,”</span> she cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“thou didst say that I am such a one as thou didst
          dream of when in the forest with Chiron, before the adventure of
          the Golden Fleece drew thee away from the Grecian lands. Oh, save
          me now from the power of her who comes in the dragon car.”</span>
          And Jason said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I said all that thou hast
          said, and I will protect thee, O Glauce.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And then Medea
          thought of the king’s house she had left for Jason, and of the
          brother whom she had let be slain, and of the plot she had carried
          out to bring Jason back to Iolcus, and a <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page287">[pg 287]</span> great fury came over her. In her hand
          she took foam from the jaws of the dragons, and she cast the foam
          upon Glauce, and the princess fell back into the arms of Jason with
          the dragon foam burning into her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Then, seeing in
          his eyes that he had forgotten all that he owed to her—the winning
          of the Golden Fleece, and the safety of <em class=

          and the destruction of the power of King Pelias—seeing in his eyes
          that Jason had forgotten all this, Medea went into her dragon-borne
          car and spoke the words that made the scaly dragons bear her aloft.
          She flew from Corinth, leaving Jason in King Creon’s garden with
          Glauce dying in his arms. He lifted her up and laid her upon a bed,
          but even as her friends came around her the daughter of King Creon
          died. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span></p>

          For long he stayed in Corinth, a famous man indeed, but one
          sorrowful and alone. But again there grew in him the desire to rule
          and to have possessions. He called around him again the men whose
          home was in Iolcus—those who had followed him as bright-eyed youths
          when he first proclaimed his purpose of winning the Fleece of Gold.
          He called them around him, and he led them on board the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>.
          Once more they lifted sails, and once more they took the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Argo</span></em>
          into the open sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> Toward Iolcus
          they sailed; their passage was fortunate, and in a short time they
          brought the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> safely into the harbor of
          Pagasæ. Oh, happy were the crowds that came thronging to see the
          ship that had the famous Fleece of Gold upon her masthead, and
          green and sweet smelling were the garlands that the people brought
          to wreathe the heads of Jason and his companions! Jason looked upon
          the throngs, and he thought that much had gone from him, but he
          thought that whatever else had gone something remained to him—to be
          a king and a great ruler over a people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And so Jason
          came back to Iolcus. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argo</span></em> he made a blazing pile of in
          sacrifice to Poseidon, the god of the sea. The Golden Fleece he
          hung in the temple of the gods. Then he took up the rule of the
          kingdom that Cretheus had founded, and he became the greatest of
          the kings of Greece.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.00em"> And to Iolcus
          there came, year after year, young men who would look upon the
          gleaming thing that was hung there in the temple of the gods. And
          as they looked upon it, young man after young man, the thought
          would come to each that he would make himself strong enough and
          heroic enough to win for his country something as precious as
          Jason’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          their lives they kept in mind the words that Jason had inscribed

              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=

              "font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate
